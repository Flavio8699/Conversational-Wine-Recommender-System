Wine;Number of reviews;Summary
Solomon Hills Vineyard;20;Along with a fascinating nose, this bottling from the appellation's westernmost vineyard offers the rounded ripeness of cherimoya, nectarine and white peach but with a laser-sharp line of crushed sea shell and flint minerality alongside scratched lemon skin. Very light in the glass, this fascinating exploration of the underripe side of Pinot Noir shows green olive and crushed cherry tomato aromas on the nose, with prevalent bay leaf, green peppercorn and pine resin. Vanilla, saffron and other exotic yellow spices are laced amidst the dried apples, dried pineapples and just-cut lemons on the nose of this wine from a vineyard on the cool western fringe of the appellation.
Don David Reserve;20;"The palate is racy, herbal, roasted and very much tastes different than most Argentine wines because it's from Cafayate in the north; look for spice, tomato, herbal waves and meaty notes. A lush, layered palate is intense but doesn't hit too hard, while concentrated blackberry, licorice and spice flavors set up a peppery, minty finish that's stout and structured. Like the 2008, this is not the easiest road to run, but it is a blast of penetrating blackberry, boysenberry, heat, spice and dark minty length."
La Joya Gran Reserva;20;Dark, crusty aromas of spice cherry, mint and black olive lead to a lively, zesty palate with strong acidity and oaky, minty berry flavors mixed with notes of carob and black pepper. This is scattered and flabby on the palate, with pithy, lightly bitter citrus flavors blending with sweet mango in front of a tropical finish with papaya, mango and sugary melon notes. Earthy, woody aromas of vanilla and dried red fruits filter into a raw, scratchy, acidic palate with plum, raspberry and medicinal flavors.
del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba;20;The concentrated palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, sweet cake spice, tobacco and herb accompanied by firm, fine-grained tannins and a vein of fresh acidity. Enticing aromas of rose, strawberry and baking spice meld together in the glass while the creamy, delicious palate doles out juicy wild cherry, black raspberry and cinnamon. On the palate, rich black cherry, raspberry, vanilla, cocoa, balsamic herbs, sage and black pepper all come together supported by brooding tannins and brisk acidity.
Sélection;20;White fruits, caramel and light spice all come into play. Its broad features are tempered by a shot of minerality and a steel note that add a crisp texture to the tropical fruits. This is a dry and elegant style of Muscat, maintaining the grape's natural fragrance along with its acidity and refreshing green fruit flavor.
Selección Especial;20;This blend of 50% Tempranillo and 50% Syrah is rubbery and pinched on the palate, while toasty, rooty flavors of black fruits blend with herbal berry and coffee notes. Rich yet subdued on the bouquet, with elegant tobacco, lemon peel and earthy scents, this feels lush and full of heft, but it's not plodding or heavy. From the Sardon de Duero region that borders Ribera del Duero, this wine is big, minty and raisiny on the nose, with chocolate and leather aromas.
Sec;20;Aromatic of honeysuckle, fresh orange peel and rye, this dry Tokaj has all the waxy, honeyed characteristics of its sweet counterparts. Full marks to Moncontour for indicating on the label that this is a dry wine (not always the case in Vouvray). It is a crisp wine, either to be drunk now or aged for 4–5 years for the secondary flavors to develop.
Eiswein;20;A relative bargain in the stratospheric world of icewine, Loosen's 2007 boasts amazingly pure fruit essences resembling candied pineapple, peach, fruit cocktail and even some red-berry notes. This is a wine on a tight-rope walk between tropical richness and lively tartness—it is thus just made for desserts that put equally tart fruits center stage. Sultry notions of honeycomb, pine sap and something more tropical—perhaps pineapple, perhaps passion fruit—converge in an incredibly concentrated and at the same time tight and light-footed palate.
Morisoli Vineyard;20;The Morisoli Vineyard has been home to very good, ageable bottlings from the likes of Sequoia Grove and Elyse, but in the last few years, Meander has expressed its terroir best. This wine shows the soft, dusty tannins and sour red cherry fruit that the vineyard is known for, while more than four years have mellowed it to beautiful drinkability. With firm, supporting tannins, it's bone dry and rich in wild berry, pepper, bacon and cinnamon spice flavors, with just a hint of raisining in the finish.
Hybrid;20;Crisp with a taste of New Zealand grass, this wine offers pear, lemon and a pinch of fig on the finish amid layers of acidity. Bright, effusive strawberry, raspberry and boysenberry aromas and flavors seem to spread out in all directions, first in the aroma, then repeating in the flavors and finish. This blend of 75% Pinot Grigio and 15% Vermentino is a light, simple quaff with some snap to it and not much on the finish.
Genesis;20;There is a hint of residual sugar, and the alcohol is just under 13%, but the overall impression is a dry, tight style with little or no floral character. Sharply acidic, with fairly strong tannins, it seems a little tight and thin, but does have the pure fruit and some length in the finish to recommend it. Aromas of barrel spice, dark fruit and black licorice are followed by full-bodied black-fruit flavors backed by grainy tannins, with baking spice flavors lingering on the finish.
Blanc;20;A collaboration between Winemakers Elizabeth Vianna (Chimney Rock), Bryan Parker (Terlato Vineyards) and Steve Fennell (Sanford), this is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc from Napa, Chardonnay from Carneros and Viognier from Sta. Lavish yet not overdone aromas of vanilla, plumeria, dried banana and yellow peach arise from the glass in this blend of 45% Viognier, 45% Marsanne and 10% Roussanne. Spices, a hint of honey, a texture of pears and white plums—this is a rich, soft wine with a good intensity of taste and ripeness.
Temperance Hill Vineyard;20;"This deep, dark, concentrated wine builds upon black cherry, vivid acids, a touch of Meyer lemon, and a powerful midpalate that unveils some gently savory notes along the way. Aggressively herbal, dark and slatey, this arresting Pinot Noir is distinctive and powerful; it won't appeal to everyone, but those who like it will appreciate its uniqueness. Tannins are sharp and just slightly green, but the most interesting aspect is the spicy, resinous, pine needle bouquet that continues right on through the mid-palate."
Hatschbourg Grand Cru;20;A very soft scent of pear rises from the glass. Richly textured wine, full of ripe and spicy fruit, the acidity just a hint behind the dried honey and watermelon flavors. The Hatschbourg vineyard in the southern Alsace village of Voegtlinshoffen is composed of clay and chalk soil on a southeast-facing slope.
Pisoni Vineyard;20;Pretty notes of black-cherry blossom and fruit are bolstered by black pepper, dried violets, deep red roses and a touch of cinnamon on the nose of this wine from the region's most famous vineyard. Rich red cherries, raspberries, red currants, concentrated rose petals and hibiscus are cut with an edge of eucalyptus oil, chipped slate and purple sage on this stellar bottling from this producer's 25th vintage. This Pinot is pretty extracted, but the flavors are addictively good, offering a cornucopia of raspberries, cherries, blackberries, tangerines and cola, with complex nuances of sassafras, orange Pekoe tea, cola and dusty spices.
Heiligenstein Reserve;20;A very slight citrus lift, edged with ripe pineapple, on the nose announces a precise palate of lusciously ripe flavors: sun-ripened yellow mirabelle plums nestle alongside ripe oranges and clementimes. There is a citrus purity on the nose that suggests fresh lemon juice, but it is tempered by some spice, like that of still-green Seville orange rind. Clean-cut and zesty with the tang of grapefruit peel, a concentrated midpalate and a refreshing dryness, this Riesling shows elegance, power and lip-smacking lemon finish.
Small Lot Blend;20;This Merlot has good plum and cherry flavors up front and is straightforward enough to pair with just about any food, but the finish falls a bit flat. This has a relatively light, traditional color with a brownish rim, complex aromas of cedar and bay leaf, with dry, mature flavors supported by firm acidity and tannins. Nicely balanced, full of tasty fruit flavors, and accented by light vanilla and nutmeg, this is a seamless wine that has lots of appeal.
Aliwen Reserva;20;However, on the nose, palate and finish you'll find a briny, almost pickled character to go with aromas of citrus fruits, flavors of melon and apple, and finishing notes of melon and lime. The mouthfeel is racy, while flavors of lime, passion fruit and grapefruit finish zesty and with green, herbal notes of thyme and oregano. Plum, cherry and pomegranate flavors drive this in the direction of red fruits, while the finish is a little woody, dry and peppery.
Demi-Sec;20;This wine succeeds because it has kept a dry background as well as strong minerality, so the almond-perfumed character of the wine is beautifully restrained and delicate. From old vines, up to 45-years-old, the wine is attractively off dry, retaining plenty of acidity as well as gaining touches of honey and creamed apples. This would work perfectly with the usual Champagne food suspects: foie gras, triple-cream cheeses and pâté, though it’s probably not the best choice for oysters.
Ravera;20;From the celebrated Ravera cru, Elvio Cogno delivers a classic and elegant expression of Nebbiolo with tight tannins, long aging potential and nuanced aromas of small berry fruit, cola, leather, licorice and smoky cedar tones. Firmly structured and youthfully austere, the palate delivers red cherry, raspberry compote, anise and clove framed in vibrant acidity and tightly-woven tannins that give it a firm finish. Radiant and full bodied, the palate is young and primary at this stage but already evokes morello cherry, licorice, pipe tobacco and aromatic herbs.
Hengst Grand Cru;20;There is a luminous quality to this wine, shining its way ahead into the future, guided by a seam of freshness and focus on the midpalate, echoing with bitter almond and more fruit. The palate has the same streamlined citrus focus and just homes in on that sleek dry apple freshness that seem to be a dynamic force at the center of this wine. That zesty notion remains a constant fixture on the very rich medium-sweet palate, countering the luscious richness of the fruit which shines with honeyed peach, juicy pear and ripe tangerine.
Camp 4 Vineyard;21;Strong white flower aromas, from honeysuckle to jasmine to tuberose, meet with fresh apple blossoms and tropical elements of banana and coconut on the nose of the bottling, a blend of 60% Marsanne, 38% Roussanne and 2% Grenache Blanc. The palate shows a touch of peach on the first part of the sip before delving into pungent grassiness that continues through the finish, all complemented by a wet stone frame. There is great lime peel and yellow grapefruit tension to the palate, which is linear and acid-driven, and possesses a chalky texture as well as warmer yellow pear flavors.
Rincon Vineyard;21;There's intensely sharp fruit character on the nose of this bottling from a single clone and block in this historic vineyard, with candied raspberry and pomegranate aromas that are leveled by Early Grey tea and pressed purple flowers. Salted peach, vanilla-smeared French toast and a hint of guava make for a very powerful aromatic impression on this wine from the Arroyo Grande appellation at the southern end of San Luis Obispo County. Riper and fruitier than last year's release, a big, juicy wine that rewards the palate with layers of blackberry and cherry on top of the usual cola, tomato and rhubarb flavors.
Sanct Valentin;21;The aromas carry over to the firm palate along with butterscotch and a mineral note but it doesn't have quite enough fruit richness to stand up to the dominant oak sensations. This opens with aromas of acacia flower, lime and a whiff of flint while the savory palate delivers Golden Delicious apple, ginger and citrus zest. The cool mountainous climate of the Dolomites has shaped a fragrant and elegant wine with tons of exotic fruit, white pepper, dried sage and tangerine.
Rocche dell'Annunziata;21;The vibrant palate displays classic Nebbiolo flavors of crushed dark cherry, clove, cinnamon, truffle, sage, thyme and licorice alongside brisk acidity and bracing but noble tannins. This traditionally crafted single-vineyard Barolo shows the forward nature of the vintage but is an excellent effort, with overripe berry, truffle and forest floor aromas. From the Rocche dell'Annunziata subzone, this well-priced Barolo offers beautifully vibrant aromas of cherry cola, chopped mint, violets and light shadings of exotic spice.
Max Reserva;21;Despite showing dusty plum and cherry aromas, this comes across lean on the bouquet, a defining characteristic that's confirmed on the palate via zesty, crisp acids and raw, tangy, herbal red-fruit flavors. Flavors of grapefruit and passion fruit lead the way, with a backing of green bean and mild bell pepper controlling a crisp, fresh finish. Flavors of orange peel, white grapefruit and passion fruit turn more pithy and pyrazinic on the finish, which keeps its juicy ripeness without turning green.
Edición Limitada;21;"Plum, blackberry and rubber aromas are solid, but the real star is the palate, which is smooth and thick, with lush dark fruit flavors and a smoky background. This wine is much better; it is still a bit saucy on the nose, and there's a touch of that herbal essence that gets into so many Chilean reds. In the mouth, however, there's more pulse than the nose indicates, as tomato-like acidity drives the palate toward a mix of cherry tomato, red plum and oak flavors."
Millésime Brut;21;This retains so much freshness, with just a hint of toast showing at the back of a wine that otherwise projects minerality, a tight structure and intense citrus acidity. Definitely dry, the wine, not from a classic vintage year, seems still young and all fruit, so it would be worth aging for 3–4 years. It has weight and concentration, and its acidity is balanced by the ripe orange and red apple flavors that are cut by a steely edge.
Heritage Reserve;21;A handful of vineyards and additions of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot make up the whole of this wine, a cool-climate style accented in spicy red currant, cherry and woody tannin. This reserve-level wine is meant to represent the best barrels of the vintage, coming from grapes grown on both the Schug Estate and Wildcat Vineyard, which makes up the majority at 80%. A Cabernet with 12% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot blended in, all from Sonoma Valley's Rancho Salina Vineyard, this wine is medium in weight and viscous.
Nimbus Single Vineyard;21;The palate on this warm-vintage Syrah feels chunky and a touch stewed, while ripe, jammy dark-berry flavors hold onto an herbal, stewy note of tomato and oregano. Dried berry and oak-based flavors of spice and wood grain finish with hints of clove on a finish that could use more harmony and depth. This feels lively and easy to take, while flavors of green herbs, grass and citrus finish a touch bitter, evidence of a cool vintage.
Klipsun Vineyard;21;Brooding aromas of spice, mineral, green herb, cedar, cherry and a minty top note lead to sweet yet elegant black fruit flavors and firm, burly tannins that need time to stretch their legs. There's a whole lot of appeal in this wine, with aromas of dark raspberries and barrel spices leading to rich, full-bodied fruit flavors with a velvety texture. Dark, dense and lush with rock, cracked pepper, Bing cherries, streaks of spice and mocha, this nicely aged and softened Merlot is full and open.
Gaisberg Reserve;21;As befits this vintage, everything is tempered with grapefruit zestiness but both mirabelle and apricot richness not only lend flavor but also a beautiful texture that insinuates quince and blood orange zest. A very subtle nose gives a mere glimpse of lemon zest, the palate delivers a thrillingly pure and exquisitely honest flavor that suggests clear mountain lakes and clean Alpine air. This wine pulls off a daring feat: despite palate weight and concentration it has a light, almost delicate, feathery citrus touch and a streamlined, fresh palate.
Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard;21;"Richly concentrated and yet able to find a balance of acidity and freshness within its voluptuous nature, this wine impresses from end to end and will do well in the cellar; enjoy best from 2023 to 2025. Mocha, baked plum and black pepper play equal roles in this stunning, full-bodied beauty from the famous site, all within a tightly focused, integrated experience of seamless texture and structure. A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from a prominent site, this wine boasts bright, juicy red cassis and pomegranate fruit supported by complex layers of dried herb, coconut and pencil shavings."
Veni Vidi Vici;21;Pale straw colored, with aromas of white flower, lemon blossom and vanilla caramel, this fills your mouth with flavors of caramelized apple tart and finishes with crisp, clean acidity and a splash of lemon zest at the back of the palate. Pale straw in the glass, this wine has aromas of lemon grass and grapefruit pith that pave the way for delightful flavors of Honey Crisp apples and red grapefruit juice. This garnet-colored Merlot has aromas of black plum, cherry and saddle leather which pave the way for soft flavors of raspberry, red plum and a smooth tannic finish.
Grande Cuvée;21;"More lush and internationally styled than their La Pompadour, the Grande Cuvée offers rich notes of creamy vanilla, jammy raspberry and blackberry, crushed violets and orange peel all graced with a mentholated lift. Each vineyard's grapes were separately fermented; the blending has pulled them all together with dark, plummy flavors, notes of raisin, baking spices and caramel, and a smooth, penetrating finish. Fournier's top Sancerre wine is released with just that extra bit of maturity, giving it extra depth and richness, and turning the initial fruitiness into something more serious."
Vaudésir Grand Cru;21;This wine has weight, richness and an intense texture and structure that brings tannins and a firm background to the generous yellow fruits, ripe apples and crisp green plums. From vines on the sunny side of the vineyard, this wine is richly textured and structured, full of generous yellow and white fruits, spice and layers of wood aging. It has a rich feel to it, touched by toast and a hint of honey, it has a firm wood aging character, a firm structure and considerable potential.
Select;21;While richly concentrated, with a plump, sunny, yellow peach and sweet lemon character, Wagner's Select Riesling boasts darker tones of bitter tea and a slightly herbal aroma that runs from start to finish. Rich and full bodied on the palate, bright, fresh apple and lemon flavors linger elegantly on the tongue with a hint of bitter lime pith. Foresty berry aromas are backed up by baking spice, cola and toasty oak notes on the nose of this chewy, dense, fairly tannic Malbec.
Coro Mendocino;21;McNab Ridge is among the few Mendocino producers to make Pinotage, so it's fitting that the variety finds its way into Coro, one of the smaller offerings of the vintage at 65 cases. Soft, still grippy tannins weave well into the midpalate and finish, signaling it as a match for roast chicken or barbecued pork ribs not too swaddled in sauce. An intriguing oak spiciness on both the nose and the palate makes this medium-bodied wine interesting without overpowering the focused and vivid raspberry and red cherry flavors.
Two Vines;21;"Tart berry fruit and some stiff tannins suggest that a bit more bottle age may help to soften it; there are already some pleasing suggestions of barrel toast that run through the aromas and on into the finish. Occupying the bottom rung (in terms of cost) of the Columbia Crest ladder, Two Vines wines are generally light, quite clean and simple, with a minimum exposure to oak. It's beginning to flatten out as a result, the freshness fading, though the fruit is still there and it is a pleasant effort, with some buttered apple flavors dominant."
Special Selection;21;Perfumed in rose, this wine devolves into a tightly tannic expression of black tea and bittersweet dried cranberry, resisting the urge to come together in a more seamless way. Blackberry tart, ripe blueberry, cassis, milk chocolate, licorice and sweet, smoky cedar flavors flood the mouth, dramatically huge and memorable, and lasting long into the finish. Apple, sweet pear, buttery oak and popcorn are the main flavors on this sweet, pithy wine that when stripped down is fairly hollow and simple.
Anna Maria;21;Though the palate can't deliver all that the aromas have to offer, there's intrigue to this estate Tempranillo with notes of dark flowers, sweet tobacco, and dried tea leaves playing off olive and other savory notes. Cabernet Franc seems to be a strength in the Rogue Valley, as the fruit expression is good and the aggressive herbaceousness of Cabernet Sauvignon is somewhat tamed. The throttle is pulled back in terms of feel while it still possesses a lot of richness to the fruit flavors and an impressively long finish.
Red Willow Vineyard;21;Coming from one of the state's top Syrah vineyards, this wine offers aromas of herb, stem, flower, smoked meat and marionberry that are followed by a velvety palate redolent with fruit and savory flavors. Coming from one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine starts out quite aromatically closed up, with notes of brambly blue fruit and herbs, along with whiffs of orange peel and smoked meat. Pale straw in color, this white has aromas of toast and cream that lead to a full-feeling palate backed by a lick of lemony acidity and barrel flavors.
Signature Selection;22;Aged a little more than two years in 90% new French oak and then in bottle, time has been kind to this wine, a Syrah of dark mushroom and baked blackberry, that's savory and silky with a slight hint of mint on the finish. Ripe and thick kirsch aromas meet with a minty chocolate lift on the nose of this bottling from one of the most important producers in Temecula, where the winery's influence is unparalleled. Here's an unoaked wine that will be great as a cocktail sipper, or with a wide range of foods, from veggies with a garlicky dip to roasted chicken or broiled halibut.
Brut Prestige;22;The winery's signature sparkler, this blend of equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, with touches of Pinot Gris and Pinot Meunier, dazzles in rounded oak and a soft texture marked by grapefruit zest and fresh nectarine. The reticent nose gives almost nothing away but the palate fills with gentle flavors of shortbread and apple peel, of slightly bitter grapefruit zest and of sprays of citrussy freshness dispersed by a lively, fine-fizzing mousse. A solid brut from Mumm Napa, this Pinot-Chardonnay blend is a little rough around the edges, but has the dry, bubbly finesse of a true Champagne-style wine.
Keefer Ranch;22;The wine is very rich and slightly high in alcohol, offering deep flavors of oak-inspired raspberry jam, softened cola and bacon, brightened with crisp acidity and chewy in finely-ground tannins. Young, vibrant and fresh, this wine's crisp acidity frames pineapple and tropical fruit flavors, with a slight hint of botrytis in the form of golden apricot and honey. From Green Valley, the coolest part of the appellation, a wine with the most wonderful opening scents of ripe pears and the smoky perfume of oak.
Los Vascos;22;The palate has weight and zest but lacks complexity, while the flavors are citrusy and green, much like Sauvignon Blanc, which is common for this wine based on past performance. There's very juicy, jammy red berry fruit here and the round, even soft palate may lack a bit of structure, but this is a flavorful, very approachable wine. It is a lean, 100% Casablanca style of SB, and while it's a step down from the great 2007, the drop is not a big one.
Kosher;22;The balance of Cabernet and Merlot has been successfully achieved, as the wine is beautifully structured with a firm backbone of ample tannins and a rich, supple mouthfeel. Apple cider, orange rind and a touch of toast unfold on the nose, while the medium weight and juicy mouth offers more fresh red apple flavors. Faint suggestions of sweet smoke and beeswax mingle with the red apple and melon flavors, adding interest to this otherwise straightforward and easy drinking wine.
Azul Portugal;22;Made from fruit that's sourced from the Buçaco Mountains in the east of Bairrada, this wine is rich and elegant, and its juicy fruit provides a counterbalance to the structure. Fruity and smooth with bright red fruit and the lightest touch of tannin, this Castelão-dominated blend has a shot of acidity to keep it all crisp. Part of a range of wines that showcases the different styles of Portugal's regions, This wine is smooth, creamily textured and with a warm ripe character.
Selection;22;The archetypal pear flavors of Grüner Veltliner come to the fore: fresh, flavorsome and crunchy green Conference pear in this case, with zesty acidity in a linear, refreshing and zesty frame. This late release sourced from several vineyards dating back to the 1970s and 1980s is thin on the palate, with tart plum, herb, orange peel and of pineapple hints. Decent acidity supports the fruit and the smooth mouthfeel is pleasing, but the wine cuts off abruptly with a somewhat short, resinous close.
District Collection;22;Soft hints of cinnamon and clove waft upwards out of the bouquet, before a wave of warm red fruit and vanilla form around age-worthy, rounded tannins. Cherry-berry crumble topped with vanilla cream gives this wine a brambly, succulent quality, dusted in light cinnamon spice, cedar and well-integrated tannin and oak. Another of the producer's 100% varietal wines designed to showcase a specific Napa Valley appellation, this one shines in juicy black licorice and dark cherry.
Les Princes Abbés;22;The nose of this wine is restrained, just giving away pear and citrus, but the dry palate is concentrated and spiced with almond and marzipan. Exotic hints of passion fruit play among fresh flavors of citrus as well as riper, juicier stone fruit for a balanced, easy wine. These flavors blossom fully on the palate and leave a most harmonious picture of ample, dry, but well-expressed pear fruit with lovely freshness.
Russian River Selection;22;The components come together in mesmerizing ways, making for a balanced and restrained Pinot that's fresh in strawberry and cherry as well as seasonings of herb and cinnamon spice, building power as it goes. There are equal parts strawberry and earth in this Pinot, sourced from the who's who of vineyard sites in Russian River, including Toboni, Hallberg, Floodgate, Rochioli and Bacigalupi. Flavorwise, it's a powerhouse, with pear, green apple, lemon meringue, buttered toast and smoky, vanilla flavors that finish in a swirl of cloves and pepper.
Monarch Mine Vineyard;22;Reminiscent of a fine Sancerre, it's finely structured, steely and still lushly textured and full enough in the mouth to enjoy with seafood, a creamy goat cheese salad or entirely on its own. A fine vintage of Bill Easton's Cabernet Franc, from the Monarch Mine Vineyard, where he typically sources tremendous Syrah and Barbera, this wine is still developing and will do nicely with time. This standout wine has enticing herb and mineral aromas, plus rich, unorthodox flavors that resemble fresh fennel bulb and crisp white peach along with racy acidity and a good, substantial mouthfeel.
Alte Reben;22;Right now, yeasty tones still swing alongside the bright stone fruit but this will soon come into its own and show off the slender but distinct and food friendly nature of Pinot Blanc. Peppery spice lurks in the background against a tightly-knit, but soft tannic structure providing additional interest and making this a versatile, fruitful and refreshing wine. True to its varietal character, this is earthy, on the rustic, farmyard side, but balanced with concentrated licorice and fresh black berries.
Le Clos;22;With some tight tannins and rich black fruits, it is a ripe, juicy wine that has intense acidity as well as a spicy aftertaste. The fruits and the acidity still have to develop, but already the wine is showing the rounded character of a great Pouilly Fuissé. The 12 months in wood adds spice and a touch of toast as well as giving the wine a delicious oxidative edge.
Thompson Vineyard;23;Though younger than most current Petite Sirah releases, this bottling impresses wildly with fragrant boysenberries and crushed lavender on the nose, proving to be a floral-driven style that's not beaten down by richness or ripeness, despite the higher alcohol level that doesn't show at all. Overly sweet and simple, and something of a disappointment given the winery's past performance, this Syrah tastes like melted cherry jam, stirred with chocolate pie filling and sprinkled with fennel and pepper. Bright purple flowers, boysenberries, tar and a waxy, fruit-coating aroma show on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard near Los Alamos that is known for Rhône varietals.
Indian Wells;23;"The Indian Wells Cabernet Sauvignon seems a little reductive at the moment; odd, since the 2005 vintage was forward, almost fat, and the wine has been in bottle for quite some time. It holds firm, dark fruits and is slightly grainy, but well-ripened tannins carry the wine, and it's less dependent upon oak treatments and flavors of vanilla and cream. But in the back, this is a stiff and fairly tannic wine, with a disconnect between the strawberry fruit and the slightly stemmy, herbal finish."
1865 Single Vineyard;23;Herbal, minty blackberry flavors are woody and show a hint of graphite, while coffee, carob and burnt toast flavors blend with green notes on the finish. A heavy, tannic palate brings the weight and thickness, while flavors of blackberry and boysenberry come with salty notes and a briny, herbal finish. Lightly herbal flavors of currant and plum are spicy and finish with oak-driven notes of toast as well as green olive and pointed acidity.
Brut Nature;23;Funky on the nose, then tangy and briny in the mouth, with lemon, green notes and pickled flavors that lose clarity and fruit content with airing. Grassy on the nose, and for a brut nature this is decidedly flat in aromas, with ultradry flavors of lime and tangerine along with powdery vanilla. The nose delivers dry apple and pear aromas, while the palate is fairly full and round for the style, with apple and lime flavors.
Reserva Especial;23;The mouthfeel is driven by hard, drying tannins, while flavors of herbal berry, roasted plum, animal and savory spices end in a peppery, sauvage type of finish. It took this Concha y Toro specialty label a few years to find its footing with Sauvignon Blanc, but in 2010 they found it. A good mouthfeel with smooth tannins is suggestive of aged Burgundy or Merenzao (Trousseau), while rooty, earthy flavors of leaves and tea are interesting.
Bernkasteler Badstube Kabinett;23;Petrol and slate aromas lead into a wine that's round in the mouth but relatively dry in style, with good length and minerality on the finish. It shows hints of wet stone, but also layers of sweet apple, pear and lemon fruit, which ease into a long, harmoniously crisp and clean finish. For a Pauly Bergweiler wine, this is atypically minerally, as its wines have tended toward the lush, fruity side of the spectrum over recent years.
H3;23;Fruit-powered, but more substantial than either the Grand Estates or the Two Vines, this shows persistent flavors of tangy raspberry and blackberry, moderate acids and plenty of cocoa in the finish. It feels taut in the middle, as if needing more bottle age and/or breathing time to flesh out, but the structure is sound and the flavors clean and varietal. The oak (40% new French and American) is up front, with aromas of barrel spices, cocoa and generous amounts of vanilla followed by cherries and blue fruit.
120;23;Turns  slightly tart on the finish, but the bright feel and the light flavors make it a good candidate for a bar pour or party wine. If you don't mind a touch of herbal pickle and rhubarb on both the bouquet and palate, then this inexpensive Carmenère will do the job. The mouthfeel is clean and mild, while flavors of white grapefruit and lime finish sweet and easy, alongside notes of dried pineapple and mango.
Gran Selezione;23;Plum, truffle, tilled earth and a hint of mocha lead the nose while the ripe, round palate offers fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry, baking spice and pipe tobacco. A blend of 80% Sangiovese, 12% Cabernet Franc and 8% Syrah, this concentrated wine opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned berry, exotic spice, vanilla and French oak. On the palate, juicy black cherry and crushed raspberry take center stage while accents of espresso, cedar, white pepper and menthol play supporting roles.
Spätlese;24;Weil's standard-label Spätlese shares the same core of minerality that its single-vineyard siblings boast, but in a slightly earthier, more rustic style marked by heady whiffs of pollen, saffron and spice. The sweetness is carried beautifully by ripe notions of peach, additional quince and apricot coulis, balanced and countered by the fresh, ripe and pliable acidity of oranges and tangerines. Sweet and richly textured, round mouthfeel with moderately intense flavors similar to nose with an added note of stem ginger and smoky spice on the finish.
Renaissance;24;A curious rosé that relies on a touch of Tempranillo to color the Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Symphony grapes, this shows sour orange and light plum on the nose. The first two, local grapes, lend a rough edge of tannins, which demands aging, but also give flavors of herbs, wild thyme and solid meaty character. A blend of rare and local Duras, Braucol and Prunelard grapes, it's firm and structured while also full of great black fruit and potential.
Conner Lee Vineyard;24;Aged for 22 months in 20% new French oak, this blend of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Merlot completes a trio of excellent Conner Lee-designates from :Nota Bene in 2009. There is a generous streak of vanilla cream, a soft and very buttery mouthfeel, yet the fruit has enough precision and focus that the wine does not lose definition. Soft, plump and fruity, this pleasing, pure Washington Merlot pushes black cherry, coffee and baking chocolate flavors into a roundly accessible wine with no rough edges at all.
Signature Series;24;Winemaker Mike Mooney adds complexity with 16% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Merlot on this bottling, which shows blueberries, crushed black rocks and dark chocolate on the nose, but doesn't offer a lot of Cab Francness. Full-bodied and exuberant in lush tannins, this black Shiraz is concentrated and rich in hearty leather, espresso and black tea yet buoyed by lively acidity and beautiful streaks of black and white pepper. Ripe and tropical in pineapple, papaya and guava, this is a medium-bodied style of the variety, lightly oaked, which shows tart lemon on the finish and a lingering accent of anise.
Blanc de Noirs Brut;24;Rich, as a Blanc de Noirs from Pinot Noir should be, this wine reflects the prime location of Mailly on the north slopes of the Montagne de Reims. Hailing from the southern Aube region, where Pinot Noir ripens well, this Champagne is rich and full, with hints of red fruit, zesty orange and lemon-tinged minerality. This ripe, dense and full-bodied Champagne is full of apricot, pear and green plum flavors that are linked with the tight, lightly tannic texture.
Brosseau Vineyard;24;Winemaker Bill Brousseau taps his family vineyard for this bottling that leans toward a more delicate style, offering light white flowers, yellow melon, tangerine peels, kumquat, Asian pear and a hint of clove and cinnamon spice. Hearty aromas of baking spices, roasted fennel, ginger and light licorice give nuance to dried cherry, cranberry, beef bourguignon and sweet onion scents on this wine from the eastside of the Salinas Valley. Up there in the Chalone hills they have a lot of limestone, and you can taste the flint and chalk in this wine even through the lavish tropical fruit and spice.
Winemaker's Blend;24;Sourcing from three different, widely drawn appellations, with 33% of the grapes from Sonoma County, this white offers lemon-lime and grapefruit around a thin core of dried mint and lavender. Here, the kitchen sink approach works well, offering classic elements of herb, leather and savory plum, with a streak of black pepper and tannins that soften in the glass. Smoky oak supports a simple, supple texture of blackberry and tobacco in this likable wine from both counties, a good value for the quality and tailor-made for the table.
Gallina;24;The elegant, firmly structured palate doles out juicy black cherry, licorice, white pepper, clove and a hint of pipe tobacco alongside firm, fine-grained tannins that need a few more years to unwind. The linear, vibrant palate still shows its youth, offering juicy Marasca cherry, cranberry, white pepper and crushed herb flavors alongside fine-grained tannins that leave a firm finish. Ripe and jammy, the dense, one-dimensional palate offers black cherry extract, star anise, oak and a hint of vanilla set against a backbone of firm, close-grained tannins.
Celilo Vineyard;24;The brilliantly displayed floral, citrus and mineral scents lead into a soft, rich and thoroughly delicious wine with layers of green berry, citrus, melon and mineral, along with refreshing acids and a streak of toasty hazelnut. This is at first a rather austere, compact wine, but it is dense with layers of flavor and representative of one of the most unique terroirs in the Pacific Northwest. A lovely counterpoint to Phelps Creek's estate reserve Chardonnay, this comes from just across the river, sourced from a vineyard on the Washington side of this two-state AVA.
Ghielmetti Vineyard;24;Soft, round and leathery tannins give way to plum, cherry, cranberry and sage in this subtly rendered Cab Franc out of one of the Livermore Valley's most vaulted vineyards, an approachable version of California Cab Franc that's moderate in price and alcohol (13.9%). A good wine, not a great one, that shows why Petit Verdot on its own is hard to make into a complete wine, although from a marketing point of view, it has a certain tale to tell. A sensational varietal Petit Verdot that's rich and velvety, lush and intense, with a hint of Bordeaux's typical herbiness, that evolves into some of the best blackberry, mocha and spicy chocolate you can imagine.
Colección;24;The fresh berry aromas are solid, and the palate is plucky and lively, with plenty of acidity to push the ripe, standard Malbec flavors of blackberry and spice. Medicinal and feral on the nose, then heavy, thick and extremely creamy and soft in the mouth, with bland, flat flavors of milk, carob and vanilla. Core berry aromas are fresh and solid, while nuances of wild herbs, leather and smoky rubber give this Malbec some character out of the chute.
Colheita Seleccionada;24;It does have a rich core of red fruit, giving a slightly juicy character, but with its tannins it will always be a firm wine, dense and serious. Firm tannins underpin the bright, bold flavors and suggest that this is a wine that could age for a few years but is also very enjoyable now. More commonly found in the Lisboa region much further south in Portugal, the Arinto is full of acidity and fits well into the Vinho Verde profile.
Joven;24;A round, pulpy palate is balanced by citric acidity, while waxy flavors of baked apple and peach finish briny and round, with a hint of green banana. A bit funky and gassy on the nose, and while the wine offers ripeness and sweetness on the palate, there's always a little something strange and sulfuric lingering. At first the nose is high toned and jumpy, but with time it falls into a good place with a medicinal berry note at the fore.
Made with Organic Grapes;24;"This feels juicy and as fresh as basic Spanish red wine gets; flavors of blackberry, dark plum and a hint of chocolate are rolled into one and finish clean. It has firm acidity, a refreshing texture, and just enough heft in the body to serve with appetizers and cheese, but will also stand up to rich seafood preparations. This feels sticky and a bit heavy, while blueberry and boysenberry flavors carry and herbal streak as well as minty notes and heat on the finish."
Natura;25;With a ruby color and loud aromas of berry fruits, vanilla and graphite, this value Syrah pumps up the volume with plenty of berry fruit, mild buttery oak, herbal hints and wiry acidity. The palate has good life and snap to it, with flavors of black cherry, plum, chocolaty oak and a dash of cough medicine. Flavors of citrus, green herbs and brine finish with a mix of bitterness and notes of tangy green apple and passion fruit.
Sleepy Hollow Vineyard;25;Although this Pinot is captivatingly rich in raspberry and cherry pie filling, red currant and Dr. Pepper cola flavors, it also has fine acidity and smooth, complex tannins, and a lovely overlay of sweet, smoky oak. Made in the modern style of superripe fruit and lots of oak, this Chardonnay is massive in the long hangtime tropical fruit, pear and peach flavors that the vineyard so easily achieves. The green fruit flavors carry to the palate, where Granny Smith apples, green Anjou pear and lime juice mix with lemon peel and white rocks.
Buissonnier;25;Apart from being part of a sparkling wine blend, Aligoté is found in the Côte Chalonnaise where it produces ripe full wines. A stalky, herbal element contrasts with the red currant fruit flavors. They have a delicious crisp green fruit and floral character.
Q;25;From a replanted single vineyard, single clone site, the first vintage since that replanting in 2009, there's a youthful awkwardness still at play here, though the wine is quite juicy in black cherry and a lingering suggestion of soy. Very light-bodied, slight but textbook Grüner with green pear fruit on nose and palate and an almost fizzy, refreshing and utterly appetizing hint of white pepper. Opening with subtle berry aromas and hints of herb, rubber and leather, this is sturdy as a rock, with dry, spicy plum and cassis flavors.
Schoenenbourg Grand Cru;25;Notes of earth mix with notes of leafy apple on the nose, the dry, fresh palate continues in that earthy vein and finishes dry with a bruised apple flavor. These wonderfully herb-scented notions continue on the exemplary dry palate: Imagine a lick of scented, dried chamomile embracing notions of dried and fresh apple and citrus peel. The palate is a fruity little number of more soft orange with hints of quince and pear peel, giving a tangy, textured and slightly earthy edge.
Sanford & Benedict Vineyard;25;A clean and crisp style of Viognier, which comes in all forms these days, this bottling is light yet expressive on the nose with yellow grapefruit, lemon ice and a touch of chamomile tea. That means it's dry, silky and rich, and has that elusive, undefinable quality of elegance that can accompany the finest Pinot-friendly foods, such as steak, lamb, grilled tuna or a wild mushroom risotto. Earthy aromas of juniper and forest floor give depth to the rusty cherry, tart cranberry, dried hibiscus and pepper-dust scents on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard.
Tondre Grapefield;25;Dark red cherry and raspberry blend with the slightest hints of thyme and slate on the nose of this bottling, which is made in a urban facility in the coastal city of Marina. Red cherry, root beer, a touch of sage and bay leaf and an shiitake-powered umami sensation decorate the nose on this wine from one of many single-vineyard expressions in this producer's portfolio. Intriguing notes of honey, poached pear, apple with drizzled caramel and a light touch of marzipan show on the nose on this bottling that leans somewhat sweet in aromas.
Estate Selection;26;The fruit is tart and clean, and the wine comes out swinging, but then it falls away in the back end, adding just a lick of vanilla as a sweet coda. This is a blend of five different Dundee Hills sites, and as is often the case in Oregon, delivers more accessible and complete flavors than some of the winery's individual vineyard-designated wines. It's fairly fresh and juicy in the mouth despite a mild resiny oak feel, and flavors of meaty berry fruits are fully spiced like a licorice gum drop.
Rosado;26;It's fairly dark for a rosé and quite full-bodied in cherry jam, pepper and vanilla flavors, while a splash of Albariño adds needed acidity and the bright taste of citrus. Flavors of orange, peach and cantaloupe are sweet but flat, and in the end it tastes more like a fruit juice than a really solid dry rosé. The nose is candied but fresh and nice, while the palate is full but standard, with plump melon, citrus and raspberry flavors.
Pfersigberg Grand Cru;26;Lifted, fresh notes of peach on nose and palate somehow manage to pull off a wine of utter freshness that is soft, mellow and rounded at the same time. Well on the way to sweet, this soft, spicy wine has light acidity and a gentle feel, with just a tangy, mineral edge to suggest some potential. These notions persist on the palate where the peach and ripe yellow-plum notes are boosted by residual sweetness and countered by phenolic, slightly zesty but pleasant bitterness.
Semi Dry;26;It's rare to grow Riesling on Long Island, but this is chock full of ripe peaches and apricots highlighted by a shower of Meyer lemon acidity and fragrant white blossoms. Pretty on the nose, with delicate floral and stone-fruit aromas, it builds in intensity and power on the palate, with a crush of sweet-tart grapefruit and nectarine flavors. Just slightly off-dry with loads of sweet, fresh apple flavors and a brisk, lemony acidity, the finish ends on an elegant jasmine tea note.
Ice Wine;26;"Once you get beyond the billowing violet and gardenia notes on the nose and palate, you're likely to find a surprisingly delicate sip that's bright with lime-juice acidity and honeyed pineapple and hibiscus-nectar flavors. Tasting more like a late harvest than a true ice wine, this soft, lush and creamy wine bring lots of mashed banana flavors, very smooth and rich, with butter, caramel and butterscotch. Spice and melons illuminate the nose; the wine displays amazing concentration, with deep, syrupy peach and apricot fruit, and a bit of sugar and toasted coconut in the finish."
Claret;26;"The herbal aspects show in some black olive and black tea flavors; the tannins are strong and supple, and the wine has a sinuous finish suggesting both strength and length. The tannins bring a bit of grip and dryness that hopefully smooths out with some additional time in the bottle but it has the stuffing to go the distance. A blend of nearly two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it brings notes of herbs, vanilla extract, cherry and chocolate."
Saralee's Vineyard;26;Tasting somewhere between dry and off dry on the sweetness spectrum, this has tropical fruit, white flower and spice flavors that make it a perfect accompaniment to modern Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Burmese and even Indian fare. Highly aromatic in white flowers and even a whiff of roses, it dances on the palate, the acidity tight and able to lift the texture to new heights of flavor and freshness. Tight in acidity and tannins now, but very complex, offering a range of cherry, tangerine zest, mushroom, cola and Indian spice flavors that swirl to a long finish.
Traditions;26;A benchmark style for Washington Riesling, this mixes stone and citrus fruits, adds highlights of wintergreen spice, hints of honeysuckle, lemon and tea, and finishes with some fruit sweetness, though the wine is essentially dry. There's a pretty fair streak of vanilla, which suggests some sort of oak chip treatment, but it fills out the middle and delivers the sort of flavors that many consumers will love. The blend was so well done that each component adds a vital piece to the whole—smooth berry and cherry fruits, spice, tobacco, licorice and smoke, folding into a lush and chocolaty finish.
Les Charmes;26;"The nose is dominated by the attractive scents of new French oak, with some hints of pipe tobacco and just a whiff of volatile acidity. It is tight and tannic, a bit ""lifted"" with the VA, and at this point not showing much fruit or complexity, given the price. A new cuvée (this is the second vintage) from Domaine Charles Joguet, the wine has tannins as well as a strongly mineral character."
Red;26;"It is difficult not to think that the winery just had an extra few barrels of Pinot around and decided to blend it in; the wine is a diffuse mix of generic red fruits and sharp acids, that thins out quickly in the finish. Toasty and full-bodied, two-thirds Cabernet, the rest Merlot, Cab Franc and Syrah, this is a nicely blended wine but not yet showing the precision and structural detail of the superTuscans it is modeled upon. Three-fifths Merlot, one quarter Cab Franc and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend shows ripe fruit scents of raisin and prune, offset with baking spices and plenty of chocolate and espresso."
Freedom Hill Vineyard;27;Full and somewhat backward, this needs a few years to sort itself out and fully express its generous nature, but you can sense the future now in its power and velvety texture. The biggest production and lowest priced of all the winery's vineyard designates, this is sexy, substantial and one of the best offerings from any winery sourcing fruit from this exceptional vineyard. A blend of fifth leaf Pommard and 30-year-old Wädenswil clones, it's lush and aromatic, sporting bold scents and flavors of ripe raspberry and cherry fruit, with a spine of iron.
Rosenberg;27;The palate is bone dry and we can thus witness the brightness of the fresh acidity counteract masterfully with the richness of a balm-like textured body, leaving a streamlined and elegant Pinot Gris. The richness gives a spicy, peppery edge to the ripe white fruit, and its acidity is almost an afterthought in this mélange of full-bodied fruit and texture. Rounded and mellow, with a backbone of lemony acid, this wine convinces on the palate rather than the nose: there's texture, fresh acidity and mouthfilling length.
Monte Rosso Vineyard;27;From a two-acre block planted to the variety within this stately place, more famous for Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is herbal in dried sage, girded in big tannin and exhibiting plenty of density. From the highly sought-after vineyard high atop the Mayacama Mountain Range, this burly red traffics in smoky leather and big, ripe, juicy black fruit, providing touches of spice and smoke along the way. Always a stellar marriage of site and winemaker, this shows an intensity of red fruit, forest and brown sugar, a streak of dried herb subtly pushing its way through, too.
Hyde Vineyard;27;Subtle fruit and baking spice aromas lead to expansive peach, pear and fig flavors riding on a wave of fresh, crisp acidity that keeps this lively through the finish, even though the texture is quite lush and creamy. The reason why this winery scores so well, year after year, in Chardonnay is because the production team knows how to get maximum ripeness out of the grapes, while maintaining an integrity of structure. The esteemed Hyde Vineyard is in Carneros, and is the source for some incredible Syrahs from winemakers like Joseph Phelps and the Hyde Vineyard label itself, and Mira now joins that list.
Ferrington Vineyard;27;Packed with fruit and tannins in almost equal measure, this robust but not heavy wine has a layered texture, bright flavors and a sense of depth and structure that indicate it will improve with time. The most fruit-driven of the Baxter 2013s, this wine has beautiful, bright cherry aromas, pure cherry and raspberry flavors, medium body and enough support from acidity and moderate tannins to provide an appetizing balance. Comes down firmly on the  herbal side, opening with a blast of lemon and dill, but interventions, including barrel fermentation, soften and fatten it and add notes of butter and vanilla.
Limited Selection;27;Baked black plum, gingerbread, dried mint, clove-laden cherry pie and a touch of light licorice show on the nose of this rich style of Pinot from the Santa Ynez-based, family-owned winery. Musty aromas of saddle leather combine with cherry soda on the nose, and the flavors prove a bit thin, with cherry, raspberry and blackberry present amidst tart tannins. Warm aromas of yellow peach, baked-apple croissant, vanilla and marzipan show on the nose of this bottling from the longtime family-run winery near the town of Santa Ynez.
Brut Reserva;27;This leans a little green and soda-like on the nose, but it picks up clarity and speed on the palate, which carries a tangy, citric snap. Floral lilac and plum aromas greet you, followed by a chunky, frothy palate with crisp core acidity and toasty flavors of baked cherry and caramel. The palate runs a little soft and low on acid and bubbles, while the flavor profile is sweet, with lime and apple at the core.
Reserva de Familia;28;"This is full and a touch heavy in feel, with herbal cassis, blackberry, toast and spice flavors that end with oak grain, additional herbal notes and spice accents. Aromas of mint and licorice complement raisin and jammy berry notes on this extracted Malbec that feels flabby around the edges despite a shot of core acidity. This wine is a cipher for the most part; it has flat apple and lemon flavors and then a maderized finish that is wheaty and suggests vanilla."
Pinot Noir;28;Red berries, blood orange, a touch of Grand Marnier, impressive body and spicy highlights all combine in a darn near irresistible rosé with the power to be a four season wine. The striking package sets it apart from all other Rex Hill wines, and the rich, complex flavors add to the impression that this is something truly special. There's sufficient acidity to take a bit of a chill-down in stride, and the finish, though bone dry, has ample fruit sweetness to round out the mouthfeel.
Terrassen;28;A funky yeasty richness still lingers on this very young wine, the palate, however, shows all the promise of a concentrated yet refreshing wine: there is ripe, juicy pear flesh at the core, framed by zesty lime that swings with the peppery freshness of arugula and watercress. This generously fruited but slender Riesling is a study in subtlety: everything is there: ripe Mirabelle plums, zesty lemon peel and a wonderful interplay of the two on the concentrated palate. Soft hints of orange zest on the nose give way to joyous, bright and sprightly lemon zest notes on the slender but concentrated palate.
La Cruz Vineyard;28;This wine opens with full-bodied, rich aromas of caramel-laced apple pie before taking on fresh lightness on the palate defined by floral apple blossom, guava and mango, the midpalate maintaining crisp acidity. Suggestions of raspberries and red cherries come spiced in white pepper and cinnamon, with richer levels of Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and red licorice, all highlighted with the most perfect acidity. Unctuous and intoxicating in dried apricot, honey and peach, this is a lovely example of the variety, which is rarely planted in Northern California, let alone on the Sonoma Coast.
Organic;28;Its bouquet is its strongest asset, offering floral, perfumy notes of white pepper and rhubarb, while the palate is on the light side for Shiraz, but clean and supple. Starts off tight on the nose, offering up only struck flint and citrusy notes, but broadens out on the palate to reveal flavors of melon and white pepper. Once past an element of burnt rubber that mingles with the ripe blackberry aromas, this becomes a hearty and concentrated wine yet one with very moderate alcohol.
Blanco;28;White wine from La Mancha has never been a Spanish strong suit, and while this wine isn't cloying, sharp or dead on arrival, it doesn't add up to much. Made from the folks behind Tangent, this blend of Grenache Blanc and Albariño is rich in orange, white flower and roasted almond flavors, brightened by zesty Edna Valley acidity. The nose is toasty and alluring, but the real play comes in the mouth, which is healthy as an ox, with layered flavors of baked apple, tropical fruits and honey.
Cuvée;28;Toasty graham crackers and nutmeg make for a compelling entry into this wine, a blend of Petite Sirah, Merlot, Carignan, Malbec, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre. A Bordeaux blend with all the usual suspects (except Malbec), Six Sigma's Cuvee has a huge Cabernet Sauvignon nose, all dark berry and plum with a hint of lavender. From Quinta Santa Rosa Vineyard, this blend of three clones shows plump red-plum and hibiscus aromas on the nose as well as sharp cinnamon, cola and sumac spices.
Icewine;28;One of the more expensive Niagara icewines, Konzelman lives up to its price tag with this stylish blend of marzipan and almond notes on the nose and an intense palate laced with macaroon and honey flavors. Sweet and spicy on the nose with mouthwatering scents of honey, plum compote and anise, this Cab icewine is rich and syrupy on the tongue with a deep core of plummy flavors. A very pretty wine with a refined aroma profile of wild strawberry, wet stone, dried cherry and peppery spice backed by rich, candied fruit flavors that manage retain deftness.
Oak Cask;29;After whiffs of burnt rubber and char blow off, this berry-packed Cabernet hits like a small brick with black fruit flavor, which packs punch and aftershocks of cocoa and coffee. Opening aromas of cola and dark fruits are belied by the tangy, edgy palate that's fresh in terms of its raspberry and plum flavors but not all that deep or complex. This value-priced winner is full, round, saturated and generous on the palate, where savory, resiny black-fruit flavors finish woody in flavor and firm in feel.
Fourchaume Premier Cru;29;Made from young vines from the Vaulorent portion of the Fourchaume vineyard, this is an open, rounded and lively wine with white fruits and weight, just lifted by acidity. While the wine has all the steely crispness you expect in a Chablis, it also offers ripe fruitiness that gives a full-bodied, round character. Hints of wood aging and a delicate mineral texture add depth to the palate, but this wine will age quickly, so drink now–2020.
Private Selection;30;It's the kind of crisp, dry white I've had many times at gallery openings and such, inexpensive, but with enough panache to satisfy a picky crowd. While it's basically dry and crisp in acidity, it offers jammy green apple, lemon and lime Lifesaver candy and vanilla notes that appeal to consumers. The Viognier does bring its trademark apricot flavor and creamy texture while the Arinto adds the bright acidity, citrus and crisp apples.
The Reserve;30;Near equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec with a healthy dash of Petit Verdot providing the frame, it displays notes of toast, coffee, chocolate, plum and woodspice with abundant blue fruit and coffee flavors. Aged in a mixture of French and American oak (33% new), this wine shows a combination of fruit and barrel, with aromas and flavors of vanilla, pencil lead, cocoa and blue fruit. A blend of 69% Cabernet and 31% Shiraz, Yalumba's 2004 The Reserve is still firm and dusty on the finish, suggesting at least another 2–3 years of cellaring are warranted.
Vintage Brut;30;This rich wine is full of ripe white and citrus fruits that combine easily with the tangy, tight texture that comes from the dominance of Pinot Noir in the blend. You can taste the dosage on this Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier brut in the overt sweetness that accompanies the pear, citrus and raspberry fruit flavors. Predominantly crafted from Chardonnay, this features a fistful of Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier to add silky smooth layers of texture and a seductively elegant body.
Vendimia Seleccionada;30;Roasted berry, marzipan, prune, spice and earth are rolled into a solid whole on the bouquet, while the palate rides on the heavy side with grating tannins and deep but clumsy flavors of blackberry, raisin and fruitcake. Potent and raring to go, with lots of young oak and intense fruit that causes the wine to change in the glass in the blink of an eye. The mouthfeel on this young Toro is full and grabby, while flavors of blackberry, oak and related mint finish peppery and blackened, with residual minty oak.
Champoux Vineyard;30;Equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with the balance (6%) Cabernet Franc, this wine leans into the savory with abundant leafy herb, flower and plum aromas that are followed by supple, flavorful earth and tart cherry flavors. From a young block of Cab Franc at the legendary Champoux vineyard, this captures the grape's earthy, herbal elements, bringing the classic green coffee bean streaks to the tannins, and keeping the fruit tight and muscular. Almost all varietal (with 2% Malbec) from one of the state's premier sites, this wine draws you into the glass with aromas of coffee, scorched earth, herb, spice and dark fruit.
Heritage;30;Smooth and supple, almost silky, this dense and delightful Syrah begins with a smoky, meaty run of sweet cherry and berry flavors, then quickly adds interesting nuances of herb and leaf and earth. Made with 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot, this estate-grown wine is made in small lots and offers aromas of baked bread and red fruit from the get-go. This blend of Petite Sirah, Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre offers a wide array of aromas to start, from cocoa and mocha to brown spice, gingerbread, dark purple fruits and potpourri.
Sur Lie;30;Totally fresh, this offers attractive, young citrus flavors that are given a broader brush by the creamed apple texture that rounds out the wine. This is just right, balanced with plenty of crisp citrus fruit and a warmer, ripe background of green plums and even apricots. Bright acidity is rounded out by warm peach and pear flavors, with a mineral texture that will allow the wine to age.
Monvigliero;30;This opens with balsamic aromas, leather, ripe raspberry, iris and a heady whiff of pressed powder while the succulent, delicious palate delivers ripe black raspberry, cake spice and aromatic herb. It opens with alluring scents of wild red berry, Alpine herb, truffle, graphite and new leather while the dazzling palate boasts Marasca cherry, clove, cinnamon, tobacco and a balsamic note. Nicely extracted and thick in the mouth with plush layers of black fruit, mineral, ash, leather and vanilla, Monvigliero shows a balanced and elegant side to the 2005 vintage.
Black Label;30;Collin Cranor is a young, eager winemaker looking to make his mark in the Livermore Valley and this wine shows off his skill and ability to work with great fruit to make an interesting wine. With some 30,000 cases produced, this well-distributed wine shows broad appeal with its bright cherry and blackberry aromas that are backed by touches of leather, tar, licorice and dried ginger. The nose is reticent, a touch of apple and vanilla, expanding into a rich seamless palate, but like its sibling, is marred by its finish, which is a little short.
Premier Cru;30;A blend of wines from a number of Chambolle's premier cru vineyards, this is a rich and generous wine, with spice and red berry flavors, plus sweet tannins and a firm feel on the finish. A blend of wines from different Premier Cru vineyards, this is firm, as befits a Pommard, but has such great ripe fruit that it feels almost opulent. It is not powerful but is deliciously balanced with fresh green plum and pink grapefruit flavors rounded out with just the perfect amount of wood.
Cold Creek Vineyard;31;Sensuous, soft and broadly laced with flavors of toasted nuts, brioche and apple pie, this luxurious Chardonnay still maintains a pleasing, focused structure that carries along flavors of lemon and apple, cut against the dominant oak. Offering pleasant, approachable flavors of apple and Asian pear, along with streaks of vanilla and butterscotch, this wine is drinking well and may best be enjoyed while it's fresh and young. Thick and sour, this wine has a waxy fruit component to it that is off-putting and out of sync with the crisp fruit that is trying to compete on the palate.
Grande Reserva;32;"With its solid tannins that are finely integrated into the rich, black plum fruit flavors, it is already a very fine wine and presently drinkable; however, another year would not hurt, so best to savor this dense blend of Alicante Bouschet, Petit Verdot and Syrah after 2017. Inky black in color, this is the top wine from Apegadas, a big, chunky wine that is characterized by dark tannins, bold berry fruits, sweet plums, but also a serious, more austere character to allow it to age. In the smooth, polished style of other wines in the Cistus range from Quinta de Val da Perdiz, this wine has mint aromas, licorice and some bitter chocolate flavors, rounded and burnished with new wood flavors."
Les Collines Vineyard;32;Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this wine starts out aromatically reserved before blossoming to reveal notes of dark raspberry, dried cranberry, woodspice, vanilla and anise. It's restrained in style with pure, tart blue fruit flavors and a light squeeze of tannins that need additional time in bottle to settle in fully. Coming from one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine dazzles the senses with notes of freshly roasted coffee, char, dark plum and sweet spices.
Bianco;32;A blend of organically farmed Chardonnay and Incrocio Manzoni, partly fermented and aged in terra-cotta amphora, this unusual but intriguing wine opens with aromas of Bartlett pear, pressed white flower and tangerine zest. This blend of Pinot Grigio, Tocai Friuliano and Pinot Blanc from three different vineyards made by winemaker Doug Margerum shows brilliantly juicy aromas of pressed pear, dried apples, apple blossoms and cantaloupe. This excellent blend of Chardonnay and Friulano offers a rich and reassuring feel in the mouth that would stand up to creamy artichoke risotto or white meat.
Grand Estates;32;"From the use of the term Shiraz (rather than Syrah) to the sweet, vanilla-and-tobacco-laden flavors, this seems to be aimed squarely at the consumer who loves a forward, round and rather soft Australian-style wine. As comfortable as an old shoe, the Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest delivers broad, open flavors of buttered fruit – almost like biting into a slice of apple pie, crust and all. There is very little suggestion of Sauvignon Blanc's herbal or grassy side; the grapes seem to have been ripened past that point, though not all the way to California-style, tropical fruit flavors."
Steirische Klassik;32;Some tropical passionfruit notes manage to appear despite the aromatic restraint, on the palate they find their expression, but are balanced by fresh lemony flavors that are almost thirst-quenching in this cracking and slender wine. Subdued citrus and pear notes on the nose find fuller expression on the rounded, very textured palate that almost seems to have a pleasingly bitter edge of earth and Bosc pear peel. A fine example of Styria's signature wine style, this Sauvignon Blanc has enticing herbaceous aromas followed by rich, full green plums, white currants and a layer of sweet, full acidity.
Marques de Casa Concha;32;Red and dense in color, with plum and raspberry aromas supported by a strong scent of barrel char, this is a generous, plump Pinot showing a mix of plum, berry and herbal flavors. Nice aromas of cherry fruit and sweetness are perfectly clean, while the palate is slightly spunky and high in acid, with wild-berry flavors running side by side with red cherry and citrus. The palate is short on substance and high on acid, so the flavors are racy and angular, and with all the oak influence this wine smells and tastes charred, toasted and blackened.
Grand Vin;33;A delicious vintage of Grand Vin, this wine shows great depth and drinkability now with the promise to age gracefully for at least another five years thanks to a ripe fruit center, medium acidity, structured tannins and superb overall balance. Smoke and dark char notes permeate the nose and palate of this Long Island Cab, but a fairly concentrated core of black fruit hides within, marked by rustic notes of earth and moss. Black cherry, cassis and wild blackberry notes dominate the nose and mouth, but supporting accents of forest and cigar box spice add depth and interest to the fruit core.
Broquel;33;For several vintages running Broquel has nudged the border between very good and excellent, but as in years past the '06 is a touch tangy and racy, with black cherry, plum and berry flavors. Cab Franc is new to the Broquel lineup, and this is lush, bold and fruity in style, with blackberry, black cherry and mocha flavors in front of a toasty, full-throttle finish. Broquel always offers a little more elegance and pedigree than most value Malbecs, and the 2005 has body, a silky feel and aromas and flavors of tobacco, baked blackberries and leather.
Nouveau;34;This first wine of the vintage, a blend of Pinot Noir, Grenache, and Valdigue, is largely the result of carbonic maceration, a winemaking technique that creates the freshest, sharpest, zingiest aromas and flavors imaginable. Structured, smoky and full of black cherry fruits, this is a wine whose appellation of Villages brings out just that extra bit of weight and richness. A classic and fun Nouveau, this has an extra side of firm tannin that adds weight to an otherwise bold, fruity and food-friendly wine.
Reserva Estate Bottled;34;Straightforward apple and peach aromas announce your basic everyday quaffing Chardonnay: this is low on minerality and acidity, and thus it tastes of banana, melon and vanilla. A crisp pulling palate holds flavors of tomato and spiced plum, while this is mild, with nothing much to speak of on the finish. Mild flavors of white flowers, orange and green herbs are light in intensity, but are coupled with a sense of roundness on the palate.
Branco;34;They don't mask the fruit too much and will integrate soon to give a rich, warm wine that has spiciness and ripe yellow fruit flavors. A wood-aged wine, with ripe yellow fruits, spice and a smooth, creamy character, kept firmly in place by apple skin texture and a flinty edge. Balanced and beautifully ripe, offering notes of apricots and fresh acidity, it's a pour that can be drunk now and will be better from 2016.
Extra Brut;34;The clean look, nice bead and good mouthfeel are the saving graces here, because it smells strange, almost like steamed ballpark hot dogs, and it tastes odd and innocuous, like papaya juice. Full of finesse, it delivers yellow apple and Bartlett pear aromas that carry over to the palate together with notes of almond biscuits and a note of vanilla. A full, yeasty wine, this has gentle acidity, with a touch of smokiness as well as a note of apple It feels full, without the necessary crispness.
Grande Réserve;34;One of the properties owned by the Fontana family, this estate has produced a firm, tannic wine with flavors of ripe black fruits, spice and dark chocolate. From old vines and aged in wood for nine months, this rich blend that is dominated by the local Negrette grape is balanced and packed with fruit. For a plump, medium- to full-bodied wine, this is pungent and citrusy, with lemon and boxwood notes that give the impression of underripeness, despite the labeled alcohol.
Brut Réserve;34;This nonvintage wine is no exception, giving a rich blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay that is ripe and driven both by minerality and white-fruit flavors. Boizel is one of those enlightened producers that indicates the date of disgorgement—and therefore how fresh the wine is likely to be—on its nonvintage bottlings. A great wine, much more than only a Champagne, this is impressively rich and ripe, with crisp yellow fruits, spices and layers of toast.
Limited Edition;34;This is a tiny-production blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon and 18% Cabernet Franc, the latter sourced from Detert East Vineyard along the Oakville bench, the former from Hendry Ranch in western Napa. But this Limited Edition bottling seems to have a tiny bit more roundness, a touch more complexity to the cassis and olive flavors, and a little more balance from front to back. Medium-intense aromas of black plum, cherry and berry are upfront on the nose of this ripe wine, with supporting notes of woodspice, char and black pepper for added depth.
Rosato;34;This is a blend of Cabernet, Pinot, Sangiovese, Zin and three other varieties, and it will please fruit-forward fans for its wealth of cherries, raspberries, cola and peppermint candy flavors. Made from the native grape Nerello Mascalese grown on Mount Etna, this salmon colored rosato offers bright red cherry, juicy pink grapefruit, nectarine, white pepper and mineral sensations. Here's a wonderful rosé wine from (made with Nerello Mascalese grapes) that opens with a dusty pink color and fragrant tones of berry fruit and crushed stone.
Family Reserve;35;"Dry and tannic, it's very rich in black currants and blackberry jam, but all of the wine's parts need more time to fully integrate; currently, the oak is forward, the acids are tart and citrusy, and the tannins are fierce. There's a touch of hot asphalt, pencil lead and miso on the nose of this first vintage from a promising, well-funded project, with dark elderberry fruit and dried dill rounding out the aromas. Enticing aromas of white lilies, nectarines, white peach, honey-lime water and chalky stone hit the nose on this wine from a new vineyard on Highway 154 in the likely-to-be-named Los Olivos District."
Red Wine;35;With delicious texture and concentration, this Lake County blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre from the 3,000-foot-high Fore Family Vineyard is intensely good, a deep reddish-purple blueberry-tinged infusion of earth and clove spice with dry, tight tannins and even a little lavender that'll linger. This blend of 44% Shiraz, 34% Merlot and 22% Cabernet Sauvignon boasts dense notes of black berry, cherry and raspberry on the nose and mouth, with soft hints of game, char and roasted cocoa nib. This Cab/Merlot/Syrah blend is very much in a Washington style, with crisp acids and tart berry and currant flavors, wrapped in chocolate and showing a few specks of pepper, presumably from the Syrah.
Kabinett;35;This starts off with some odd wet wool and fresh tar notes, but quickly rights itself, delivering a medium-bodied mouthful of crisp lime and melon fruit. While demure on the nose with faint hints of blossom and mineral, the palate of this sprightly kabinett surges with ripe yellow cherry and peach flavors. Deeply mineral from nose to finish, this off-dry kabinett balances lush peach, apricot and grapefruit flavors with striking earth tones of wet slate and granite.
Seven Hills Vineyard;35;Though Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc each make up just 3% of this wine, they seem to show themselves aromatically, with herb and floral notes that provide the backdrop for Merlot's cocoa and cherry. Plush, briary, brambly fruit from the 30 year old vineyard brings an extra dimension to the wine, which shows a lovely balance of cranberry, raspberry, pie cherry and baking spice flavors. The Cabernet Franc brings some floral highlights to the nose, while the sturdy Merlot—dressed in accents of incense and sandalwood, cocoa and cinnamon—powers its way through a marvelously long finish.
Reserva Branco;36;One of the two estates in the Douro still in the hands of descendants of Dona Antonia Ferreira, who created so many Douro quintas, Vallado is able to produce great white wines as well as reds and Ports. Port made from white grapes is a great cocktail base (think white Port and Tonic for a start) as well as a delicious drink in its own right. This wine, well poised between sweet and dry, is a rich golden color, with dried apricot and plenty of fresh citrus to give it a crisp texture.
Winemaker's Reserve;36;Redolent with a fertile mix of moist earth, compost, tobacco and floral highlights, it fills the mouth with a rich and seamless mix of plums, baked cherries and barrel notes. The powerful black currant, black cherry, carob and tobacco flavors, wrapped into rich, soft tannins, suggest holding at least through 2008, and the wine should develop well for a decade. It's not just the peach, pear and tropical fruit, or the honeyed, vanilla-scented buttered toast, or the oriental spices, or the clean acidity, or the rich, creamy texture.
Flood Family Vineyards;36;Bright and plump fruits of black plum and boysenberry are drizzled with tar and dusted with savory peppercorns on the nose of this bottling, which also has a gamy hint of roast lamb. Green plum, mowed lawn, pungent green apple skins and a touch of candied peach ripeness make for a classic Sauv Blanc nose on this bottling from one of the region's oldest producers. Sweet cedar aromas kick off this attention-grabbing bottling, with elderberry and black plum scents combining for an Old World feel in which the structure can be sensed on sniff alone.
Les Clos Grand Cru;36;Its green and white fruits are layered with wood spice and an ineffable crispness that allows the wine to show the purity of Chardonnay and the great terroir at the same time. Tensely textured with young fruits that have a touch of bitterness, the wine offers kiwi and green plum flavors given a more exotic character with some mango. The most serious of the Chablis Grand Crus has produced here a wine that combines that firmer nature with generous yellow fruits, toast and tender acidity.
Rosso;37;Montefalco Rosso is the less austere cousin of Sagrantino di Montefalco and although this blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino and Cabernet Sauvignon offers all kinds of spice, cherry notes and firm tannins, it is too masked by heavy oak tones. Bright and savory, this charming blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Teroldego doles out juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, cinnamon, white pepper and crushed Mediterranean herb. Made with 85% Nerello Mascalese and 15% Nerello Cappuccio, this radiant red boasts a beautiful fragrance of blue and red flower, ripe berry, cake spice and aromatic herb.
Alpha;37;Warm, rubbery berry aromas mixed with smoked meat and herbal accents make for a solid nose, and while the palate has clampy acidity and herbal notes, there's ample body, roundness and berry fruit to bring it home. A truly complex and layered style from deep in SoCal, this blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah brings aromas of smoked chocolate, smashed strawberries, dried rose petals and oregano. A lot of ripe apple, creamy butter and pear aromas make for a friendly opening, while the palate is plump and weighty, with toasty melon, citrus and buttered pear flavors.
Sierra Mar Vineyard;37;Warm aromas of lightly buttered apples, lemon cream croissant, yellow cake and dainty caramel invite the nose into this bottling by retired pro baseball players Dave Roberts (today manager of the L.A. Dodgers) and Rich Aurilia. There is a nice sizzle of acidity right away on the palate, and a pithy, cement-like grip, as well as full flavors of apple and peach blossoms that are rich and yet not overpowering. A brilliant Chardonnay, displaying both the terroir of this fine upland part of Monterey County, and the cool vintage that let the grapes hang on the vines until they were perfectly ripe.
Cuvée Tradition;37;This medium-bodied, silky-textured rosé features modestly confected aromas of bubble gum and cotton candy, which give way on the palate to vinous notes of cherry and wet stone. Aged in wood from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, this rich wine has sweetness, just enough tannins and wood to give structure, and a deep red cherry fruitiness. Dominated by 80% Merlot, this ripe and firm wine is full of red berry fruits with a solid, dry core that comes from the fruit tannins.
Sierra Madre Vineyard;38;Mossy, dank, forest-floor aromas of juniper, chaparral shrub, pencil lead and spiced porcini mushrooms mix with a cooked rhubarb character on the nose of this wine from single-vineyard specialist Bill Brosseau. The vineyard is in the Santa Maria Valley, and the wine shows that area's crisp acidity, as well as long hangtime orange, Meyer lemon and golden mango fruit flavors. Pink grapefruit, a linear chalky component and the aromas of apricot jam on brie cheese rind show on the nose of this bottling from one of the region's oldest vineyards.
White;39;This Bordeaux blend is partially barrel fermented and aged in one-year-old oak, which explains why this blend of 56% Sémillon and 44% Sauvignon Blanc has both an oakiness and a steeliness over its pear and citrus fruit. There's been a huge jump in production of this wine since the past vintage, which may signal some surge of interest in white Pinot, which has lately become a bit of a trend in Oregon. This stone-soil, cool-climate region of Monterey is the perfect place to grow a German-style Riesling and keep the price down, because costs there aren't as high as in the North and South coasts.
Made With Organic Grapes;40;Fermented entirely in stainless steel without undergoing ML or barrel aging, it delivers everything you love about the variety, inviting one in with melon and minerality, then following through with a surprising creaminess and almost decadent, mousse-like finish. Winemaker Mike Lee continues to prove his prowess with Sauvignon Blanc in this latest vintage of Patianna, Patti Fetzer's line of organically farmed wines from outside of Hopland in Mendocino County. Bonterra sources organically grown grapes from both Mendocino and Lake counties to craft this light, slightly sour white generous in kiwi and a pronounced aroma and taste of honeydew.
Unfiltered;40;Planted originally in 1975 to heritage Wente clone Chardonnay by owner/winemaker Tom Dehlinger, its generosity of fresh apple and pear ride a voluptuous, balanced texture that's wholly satisfying, before meeting deeper hues of spicy, exotic tropical tones on the finish. Moderately intense on the nose with dominating earthy, forest floor notes backed by red plum guts and cherry along with a hint of vanilla ice cream with raspberry sauce swirled in. New winemaking and a sizable replanting effort at the producer's Spring Mountain estate are starting to show dividends in this new release, a full-bodied style true to its heritage.
Soberanes Vineyard;41;The palate is very high-toned and pithy with flavors of pear skin, Key lime, chive, sea salt and a touch of smoke, leaving the mouth with quite a sizzle on the finish. Stark minerality, from hot gravel to chipped slate, meets with garrigue elements of lavender and thyme on the nose of this strong bottling that gains a savory quality thanks to roasted-pork aromas. The firm structure implies that this wine will improve with time, but it's already deliciously savory with lots of thyme, anise, menthol, charred beef and pepper throughout the purple fruit flavors.
La Encantada Vineyard;41;Rick Longoria is all about restraint in his winemaking, and that shows on the shy aromas of this bottling that allow hints of black plum, wildfire, roasted meat and light rosemary to emerge. All of those elements are interwoven on the sip, where a core of fruit punch is laced by bay leaf, kalamata olive, bergamot and Christmas spice that persist deep into the finish. If you love fruit, you'll savor the endless flavors of raspberries, cherries and persimmons that are brightened with a squeeze of zesty, lime-like acidity and enriched with the smoky creaminess of oak.
Selección;41;Dense, roasted, earthy aromas of lightly stewed berry fruits and leather set up a deep, oaky palate with baked, loamy dark-fruit flavors that finish smooth, mellow and rich in feel. Powerful and oaky on the palate, with a creamy vanilla flavor, this brings on the blackberry, mocha, cocoa and toast as it works its way to a clean, long finish. This is Alamos's top Malbec, and it is fat and savory on the nose, with rubber, leather, asphalt and cured-meat aromas in addition to showing jammy fruit scents.
Shea Vineyard;42;The entire 2008 lineup from Panther Creek shows consistent flavors that deftly mix tart but ripe berry fruit with layers of dusty spice, hints of barnyard and lightly grainy tannins. The characteristic blackberry fruit shines through, but winemaker Adam Campbell has wrapped it in the sort of elegant, lightly herbal, spicy flavors that define the Elk Cove style. The fruit is set against clean acids and supple tannins, and flavors remain full and focused with details of baking spices all through the long finish.
Proprietary;42;A powerful waft of red fruit and tannin combine for an agreeable wine that'll do well across palates, appealing to those who like some weight and body to their wine and to others who like a wine priced under $30. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (55%), Merlot (36%) and Petit Verdot from the Seven Hills and Loess vineyards, aromas of dried high-toned herb, cocoa and barrel spice intermingle on a wine that has yet to fully reveal its charms. Co-fermented Syrah, Petite Sirah and Zinfandel from the Mounts Vineyard in Dry Creek Valley were all picked the same day for this blend that's tight, sinewy and smoky in sanguine notes of baked plum, cranberry and baked bread.
Garys' Vineyard;44;The nose on this bottling from the iconic vineyard co-owned by the Pisoni and Franscioni families is quite sultry, with lots of violet and purple-flower aromas as well as mulberry, black raspberry, forest floor and grilled meat. Deep, rich aromas of baked plum, rhubarb pie, star anise, red cinnamon, forest floor and gingerbread show on this nose of this wine from a vineyard planted by the two Garys, Pisoni and Franscioni. While this wine is enormously tannic and dry, it shows a complex range of blackberry and stone fruit, tobacco, currant, charred meat bone, black pepper and mineral flavors, with the oak influence evident but subtle.
Special Reserve;44;Plum clafouti and a marriage of cherry and clove provide a foundation above which lies a spicy mix of dried herb and cedar in this integrated, softly approachable wine of medium-build and length. Tangy and showing some good aging, this is a ripe wine that has a bite of spirit and acidity making it dry, with touches of the old wood used in the aging. Smooth, medium-bodied layers of pomegranate, red currant and a refreshing sense of citrus make for a light, food friendly companion, especially with the wine's satisfying bite of acidity and lengthy finish.
Estate Vineyards;45;Tremendously pretty with honeysuckle and apricot highlights and memorable texture as well as a bright, crisp finish, this Chardonnay makes for a very good food wine, its cool-climate grapes grown organically along the banks of the Russian River. Blended with 12% Sauvignon Blanc and coming from a mixture of Les Collines, Goff and Seven Hills vineyards, this wine brings aromas of lees and fig that are followed by lightly creamy well-balanced fruit flavors. From a grape that's rarely planted in the Central Coast, this bottling shows loads of earthy aromas, from wet soil to crushed gravel, as well as tight blackberry, dried dill and white pepper notes.
Paragon Vineyard;46;Very pithy aromas of grapefruit, squeezed lemon, crisp Asian pear and a touch of chalk show on the nose of this bottling, another strong argument about how well this variety can do in cool coastal California. There's no oak on this delightfully dry wine, although you'd never know it from the rich streak of vanilla and smoky butter that accompanies the orange, apricot, lime and honey flavors. Baking soda, ripe citrus pith, lime blossoms and a soft petrol touch show on the nose of this wine from a vineyard to watch in southern San Luis Obispo County.
Blanc de Noirs;46;Made entirely from Pinot Noir grapes, this méthode Champenoise sparkler is golden peach in color with attractive aromas and flavors of orange blossom, hazelnut, orange peel and a slight sense of garden herbs. A touch sweet, yet full and not at all cloying on the palate, this tangy middleweight from this well-known Napa marque finishes evenly with licorice, tart fruit and a slight candied note. This Blanc de Noirs—91% Pinot Noir with small amounts of Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier—opens with a tad ripe, with a light and airy mousse and a predominance of strawberry flavor.
Rosé Brut;47;Following the elegant Deutz tradition, this wine has a character that is light as a feather, but still anchored into vivid red fruits and tight acidity, leavened by a softness. An all-Italian blend of Garganega, Pinot Bianco, Chardonnay and Nerello Mascalese, this bright rosé sparkler is easy-going and clean, with pretty citrus and almond notes on the close. The dominance of the two Pinot grapes gives it a slight texture and tannic edge although this is smoothed out by the soft finish from the relatively high dosage.
Boushey Vineyard;47;Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this wine shows a downright mesmerizing sense of purity with its aromas of purple fruit, herb, fresh flower, earth and iron. But the complexity and depth of Boushey fruit is there, and the wine takes you on a ride through a mélange of intriguing herb, fruit, cured meat and barrel flavors. A blend of three new Syrah clones that were fermented separately, then blended into a satisfying, though still young and somewhat jagged wine that will benefit from more bottle age.
Bussia;49;Here's an expression of Nebbiolo from the celebrated Bussia cru that opens with juicy fruit tones of cherry and blackberry backed by charred notes of campfire, cured beef, cigar box, leather and crushed granite. This vintage of Prunotto's celebrated Bussia cru is also on the mature side (but not as much as the hotter 2005 vintage) and offers ripe aromas of blackberry preserves and strawberry. The tightly wound palate is still rather closed and on the lean side in terms of fruit richness, but slowly reveals sour cherry, licorice and a note of ground pepper.
Bacigalupi Vineyard;50;From the historic vineyard site planted to old Wente, this wine offers a silky-smooth character on the palate, which is generous in its aromatics of apple blossom and peach, with just the right sizzle of tangy lemon-driven acidity. From the historic family-owned vineyard down a ways on Westside Road, this Bacigalupi wine is richer and more layered than some of the producer's other vineyard-designates, providing a meatier, more tropical edge of fleshy butter and nuttiness. Piquant in allspice, this soft, single-vineyard designate from a property known for Pinot Noir conveys a sense of elegance and subdued tannins, offering plum and red cherry atop shy waves of cedar and sage.
Premium;52;It has flavors of pink grapefruit, almond paste, toast, vanilla and lemon curd and a slightly savory undercurrent on the palate that surges forward with notes of thyme and oregano on the finish. This powerful blend of Petite Sirah, Petit Verdot, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc is smoky with oak and thickly concentrated on the palate, with sweet blueberry fruit and dark chocolate flavors. In the mouth, this is lively and medium bodied, while nice acidity allows it to roll over the palate while showing earthy flavors of black fruits and rubber.
Colheita;53;Aged in barrels in the cool cellars in Azeitão, this wine combines great freshness with spice, toast and acidity that come together in a sweet, honeyed aftertaste. Using the four main grapes of the Dão region—Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Alfrocheiro and Jaen—this is an impressive wine, with solid tannins and a crushed-stone texture. Because of its relative youth (for a wood-aged Colheita), this is almost a Late Bottled style, with ruby color and a fruity, red berry character.
Gap's Crown Vineyard;54;Tightly coiled in fruit and oak, this is a young yet vibrantly lush, plush and juicy wine.It's ready to expand on the palate as it opens to reveal exotic baking spice, textured velvety softness and swathes of black cherry and pomegranate. Smooth and juicy in red fruit with an edge of more savory cranberry, this wine from a great vineyard source rises to its occasion and to its site, offering high acidity, medium weight and a lingering, nearly spicy finish. The second vintage by this producer from this highly regarded vineyard, this wine shows how racy the site can be, cooled from Petaluma Gap winds and fog and yet also robustly capable of ripe, rich red fruit.
Sangiacomo Vineyard;54;Made from two vineyards in the cool Carneros district of Sonoma, it's ripe in pineapple and green apple flavors enhanced with the toast of oak, the creaminess of lees and the buttery softness of malolactic fermentation. Tastes riper and oakier than in previous vintages, giving it a somewhat flamboyant personality, but lovers of this California style will be impressed by the pineapple custard, butterscotch, crème brûlée and smoky oak flavors. The producer's original source of Chardonnay, Sangiacomo grapes have figured into this wine since 1987, this vintage of which is astounding in tropical, fleshy layers of elegance, flecks of freshly cut pear providing further succulence.
Ciel du Cheval Vineyard;55;"A blend of Cabernet Franc (35%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (18%) with the rest equal parts Merlot and Petit Verdot, this wine offers brooding notes of herbs, black currant, mineral and flowers. The oak (40% new French) is dialed back, allowing rich, layered notes of plum, herbs, licorice, toast and coffee to rise with a firm scaffolding of slightly dry tannins supporting them. In 2008, Januik made a single-vineyard Syrah from Lewis Vineyard fruit; now the winery has sourced fruit from Ciel du Cheval Vineyard, one of the superstar spots on Red Mountain."
Cannubi;56;On the palate it proved to be soft and chunky, with most of the flavors at the front, and although the flavors were not as intense in the mid palate, they did return and the wine ended with a pleasant medium finish. One of the best expressions from the classic Cannubi vineyard area, this fragrant red is all about finesse, opening with enticing scents of perfumed berry, iris, rose, chopped herb, baking spice and new leather. The tight, compacted palate isn't extremely expressive but eventually reveals suggestions of raw cherry, grilled sage, clove and a hint of orange peel alongside drying tannins that leave a firm finish.
Proprietor's Reserve;57;Supple and inviting, this mellow take on Cabernet Franc has soft cherry-pie flavors, a dash of pepper, and a smooth, chocolaty finish, with a pleasant, toasty, caramel aftertaste. The palate as well is rich with red fruit, dark brambly notes and soft supple tannins, but the tomato leaf flavors that linger throughout are a distraction. But it is clean and vibrant in acidity, with rich pineapple jam and green apple flavors, and the underlying tang of minerals helps to ground it.
Stagecoach Vineyard;58;This Rhône-inspired red from a great site takes a lovely, light-hearted approach to the variety, capturing its ability to conjure black olive tapenade and savory, leathery texture while keeping the ripeness of the fruit more elusive. Made from this Bordeaux blending variety seldom seen bottled on its own, the grapes were grown in the Stagecoach Vineyard, high up on Atlas Peak, increasingly a source of some of Napa's greatest red wines. Still tightly wound, it shows complexity and plenty of natural structure, begging for more time in the bottle to allow for the gunpowder, smoky oak and dark, lush black fruit to marry further.
Dutton Ranch;59;"This is a robustly reduced, tightly wound and still quite youthful wine, showing both the vintage and the appellation in warmer years, with an intensity of black tea, tar and black cherry. Lengthy and complex, it draws much of the fruit from Dutton's Mill Station Vineyard in Green Valley, an appellation that can deliver lots of spice and minerality; both are on display here. Dark gold in color and intensely cradled in oak, this wine maintains a balance of complex, well-defined flavors of honey and apple, with lurking minerality that keeps it fresh and lively."
Durell Vineyard;60;It also has enough firm tannin and acidity to keep the structure lively and the finish fresh, so it's a lot of fun to drink and can take on all kinds of rich proteins at dinner. From a tremendous site sourced by the producer for multiple vintages, this wine shows a charismatic match of winemaker and grapes, beginning with a lean, bright entry that's smooth and rounded on the palate. From a newer planting of the Durell Vineyard called the Ranch House Block, this Pinot is rocking in deep, delicious baked strawberry and raspberry fruit, fruity, lush and spicy yet balanced and tempting.
Rosella's Vineyard;61;Software developer-turned-vintner Mike Officer comes south from his Sonoma base to Monterey make this lavish Syrah that shows layers of blueberry, blackberry and black cassis as well as potpourri and ganache elements. With its eruption of berry, cherry, milk chocolate and anise spice flavors and dramatic tannic structure, it's not particularly subtle, but will excite fans of extracted Santa Lucia Highlands Pinot Noirs. Reviewed at slightly more than two years of age, it tastes of fresh young primary fruits, such as cherries, raspberries, blackberries and cola, and the sweet, smoky oak stands out apart.
Trocken;65;A good value in dry Riesling, this bottling features potent petrol, truffled honey and pineapple notes on the nose, while on the palate it's medium bodied, turning crisp and lean on the finish. While bright cherry and berry aromatics take a bit of aeration and coaxing to flourish, this four-square wine calibrates juicy primary red fruit with cool touches of menthol and cranberry acidity. Slight hint of sulfur at first, but it blows off and the nose opens to reveal a rich medley of ripe orchard fruit tinged with dried tarragon and savory spice.
Vintner's Reserve;65;It's dry, tannic and full-bodied, just what you want in a steak-friendly wine, and the amazing flavors range from blackberry and cherry jam through cassis and plums to toast, smoked meat, vanilla, black pepper and dark chocolate. KJ's Mendocino County Zin has both red and black berry fruit flavor and the spiciness one expects from dry-farmed Mendocino County vineyards, though the tannins stick around a bit longer than one might like. Made in a family winery based in San Francisco that sources fruit mainly from Lodi, this Sauvignon Blanc is rich with fig and Nilla Wafer notes, with a pretty, floral nose.
Roble;65;"This label has turned a corner from its early days; the 2005 is a very nice wine with smooth, ripe berry aromas backed by black cherry, smoked meat, coffee and other savory, dark flavors. Dense in color, with big, oaky aromas of clove, wood grain and vanilla on top of berry-fruit scents, this resiny, rugged RDD tastes of minty, dark oak along with blackberry and plum flavors. Flavors of roasted blackberry are rubbery and come with oaky vanilla, while this feels good on the finish with an overriding oak character in the driver's seat."
Limited Release;67;Young and still intensely oaked, this wine holds undeniable promise in its fleshy, viscous and smooth layers of stone fruit and guava—an untrammeled expression of the Napa Valley's ability for generosity and structure. Sanguine in cranberry, red plum and dark cherry, this wine offers sizable tannin and oak around more savory elements of tobacco and black tea, an introduction of soy on the full-bodied finish. A partnership between the Delicato Family and country musician Zac Brown, this well-made wine shows a wealth of flavor and complexity, from dusty saddle and earth to black cherry and berry.
Prestige;68;As pale in color as is possible for a rosé, this is bright, crisp and fruity.It has delicious acidity and red apple and citrus flavors, with a burst of red currant on the finish. Spanish broom, white flower and mature white stone fruit notes commingle on the nose The round, ripe palate offers white peach, juicy pear and candied nectarine flavors, with a bitter almond-inflected finish. Starts off with melon and a touch of almond character, then adds brighter pineapple notes that turn tart and metallic on the finish, a poignant counter to the wine's breadth on the palate.
Semi-Dry;73;Gorgeous on the nose with aromas of honeyed apples and dried figs, this off-dry Riesling is surprising light on its feet with a dainty palate of sweet pea blossoms and white peach nectar. A sinewy wine that begins with ginger, lemon curd and white peach that give way to a slightly watery palate with a silky texture and good acidity to balance the substantial residual sugar. Slightly floral on the nose, with some pear and nectarine as well, this light-bodied wine blends sweet stone-fruit flavors with tart green apples on the palate, giving it a degree of balance.
Tinto;73;"A mix of grapes from southern Portugal and the north along with a hint of Syrah, this is a stylish wine, feeling fresher and lighter than its alcohol would suggest. However, the palate on this venerable Ribera wine is a bit jumpy and early on it seems tart and miserly; the upside is that the wine will age for 15 years. A field mix of seven varieties, this is a sanguine, thick and rich wine, softly layered in licorice, fig and cranberry, with a big presence on the palate."
Private Reserve;74;Sausal has some of the oldest vines in Sonoma County, and despite ripe raspberry, blackberry, cola and chocolate flavors, this wine has a taste of the earth that must come from the vine roots reaching deep into the soil. Quite good and rich in jammy berry, cherry, cassis and oak flavors, but there's a certain obvious appeal that lacks complexity, and it's not what you expect from a wine of this reputation and price. Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas produces this label with her father and winemaker Joey Tensley, whose handiwork unleashes aromas of white pepper, black cherry, a cornucopia of dark berries and earthy minerality.
Collection;75;Fresh, clean and easy with ripe aromas of red apple flesh and hard nectarine on the nose and a solid lime-driven citrus core that livens up the palate and the finish. It is round and full in the mouth, with rich flavors of green apple, guava and tropical fruits with a slight hint of toast that carry on through the long-lasting finish. This is one compact package of citrus flavors: the nose is shy but the palate is a slender, taut but expressive parcel of zesty lemon and lime notes.
Signature;77;From the family that has made the variety from a three-acre block on Pritchard Hill since the 1960s, missing a few years to replant, this is such a lovely, well-composed and deliciously enjoyable wine it might induce tears of happiness, that's how good it is. A lively, balanced wine at an accessible price point, Marquee's 2008 Signature Chard boasts aromas of smoke, vanilla and stone fruit and flavors that follow along similar lines, with white peach and pineapple coming to the fore. Sure, it's ripe and sexy with a lot of sweet oak characteristics like cocoa powder and smoky wood, but it's got the ripe fruit core of black plum and dark forest berries to back it up.
Blanc de Blancs;79;It's also a tad sweet on the palate, especially for today's sparkling standards, but will surely attract a wide fan base thanks to apple custard, cotton candy and plumeria-like flavors, all dissected by racy bubbles and acidity. Made from 90% Chardonnay and 10% Pinot Gris, this lovely Blanc de Blancs brims with vanilla cream, lime and pear aromas and flavors, with the yeasty, baked bread dough toastiness that mark the best sparkling wines. The best of a strong series of sparklers from this winery and vineyard on the western edge of the appellation, this Chardonnay-based bubbly shows light toast, chalk and lemon mousse on the pure and appealing nose.
Grand Reserve;80;Olive, blackberry and toasty oak all give hope, but when this wine crosses the palate the acidity is so intense that it causes you to take count of your cheeks, tongue and teeth. Good winemaking lies at the heart of this wine, which also blends in smidgens of Cab Franc, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Malbec, the grapes from a range of estate-grown sites. Fairly hard and tannic on the palate, this shows herbal plum flavors in front of a bold finish with dry tannins and a hint of wood spice.
Stillwater Creek Vineyard;81;Everything is tied together in a neat and tidy bundle, with sweet blackberry fruit surrounded by leaf and earth, leading into ripe but stiff tannins and just the right elements of mocha toast. Barrel-fermented and aged sur lie for 10 months, this elegant Chardonnay offers immaculate scents and flavors of lemon rind and pith, a dusting of spice, and a generous slice of ripe apple. The oak—a mixture of new and used French and American—takes the lead on this wine, with aromas and flavors of vanilla, cocoa and coffee out in front of plum and dark fruit.
Barrel Fermented;83;A tasty tang of toasted oak adds a great top note to this full-flavored and full-bodied wine, so that it seems to build complexity from the bass notes of ripe pear, to the butter and cinnamon in the middle and up to the wrapping of spicy, smoky oak. Despite being barrel fermented, this attractive white manages to maintain a vivid vibrancy and freshness, with notes of fresh red apple, firm peach, pineapple core, green mango and clementine that are all infused with delicate hints of toasted oak and baking spice. This is barrel-fermented Viura (with 10% Malvasia), but there's nothing woody or overtly barrel-dominated about the wine, which is tight and citric on the tongue, with tangerine, green apple and nectarine flavors that finish racy and tart.
Cuvée Prestige;84;On the toasty, oaky side, but with just enough citrus and melon fruit to support it, this is a creamy, lush rendition of Saint-Péray that does a nice job integrating the oak into the body of the wine. A rich and rounded wine from a top Beaujolais vintage, this is ripe and full, packed with black cherry flavor and tannins that have now fully integrated into this warm wine. This golden-hued sparkler opens with aromas of yellow orchard fruit, citrus and a whiff of bread crust that carry over to the crisp palate along with a nutty note.
Old Vines;86;Made by Paso Robles-based Ranchero from old vine Carignan grown in Mendocino's Redwood Valley, this still-young rendition of this rough and tumble Old World grape is densely rich and textured with aromas of blackberry and blueberry, clove and tobacco, with a nice kick on the finish. A blend of Champoux (62%), Sagemoor (26%) and Woodward Canyon (12%) estate vineyards, this wine is aromatically brooding at present, with notes of coffee, toffee and vanilla bean alongside high-toned cherries, dried herbs and flowers. Scents of underripe tropical fruit, green plum, apple and lime peel are kissed with hints of rose petal, ginger and honeysuckle, while the medium-weight palate boasts ripe flavors of green melon and fleshy pear.
Estate Vineyard;86;Made from head-trained vines planted where California winemaking pioneer Agoston Haraszthy first grew the variety 150 years ago, this lush wine offers intense aromatics of tar, brick and smoke, with briary blackberry secondary on the nose. It saw 10% stem inclusion during fermentation and was aged in 20% new oak for just over a year, a recipe that works to buoy the wine and give it plenty of complexity. While the winery's regular 2010 Diamond Mountain Cab is a barrel selection, this Estate Vineyard selection consists of only the darkest, most extracted lots, from the winery's various vineyards, according to the winemaker.
Blanc de Blancs Brut;88;Produced from Chardonnay grown on the Montagne de Reims and in the Sézanne region further south, this is a fresh wine, more fruity than mineral although with a definite tilt towards citrus acidity and perfumed acidity. The palate confirms this near weightless lightness and underlines it with fine tiny bubbles that fizz away creamily, providing a counterpoint and resulting in a wine that is both exquisitely light, dry, creamy and elegant. This is one of five Champagnes by entrepreneur and rapper Jay Z under the Armand de Brignac Empire brand that is produced by the Cattier family, in Champagne since 1763.
Late Bottled Vintage;92;It has much of the same intense fruit as the vintage wines but with the advantage of longer aging in barrel to allow the rich dark plum and spice to be more ready to drink. Bottled in 2015, this ripe LBV from the great 2011 vintage achieves a fine balance between firm, dry tannins that promise some aging and sweet black-cherry fruits that are attractive now. From one of the great names of Port, this LBV is a richly sweet wine, full of dried fruits, balanced acidity and a soft, smooth texture.
Classic;97;Slight notes of grass and stone fruit on the nose become more pronounced on the light but intensely flavored palate which bursts with zesty freshness and leaves the mouth bathed in green, leafy aromas forever. Cherries galore on this easy, pretty red: the palate adds appetizing sprays of white pepper to the crunchy, moreish fruit, leaving you with a just about medium-bodied red of immense bounce and freshness. The subtle palate has the softest tannic grip, as if made of translucent red gauze, and majors on earthiness rather than fruit, as so many food friendly, traditional Austrian Pinot Noirs do.
Barrel Select;98;Coming from a vineyard west of Paso Robles that peeks at the ocean surrounding Morro Rock, this is a dense expression of the grape, with dried strawberries, blackberries, smoked pork butt, star anise and lots of smoke on the nose. This wine has the kind of beefy, muscular character that one expects in a Cab, with its earthy berry and leathery spice nose, and a layering of tobacco smoke, black pepper and rich berry on the palate. From this Temecula producer, a barrel selection of plum and black cherry Zinfandel with good depth and structure that's still got some tannins to work out but is ready to drink now.
Unoaked;101;Unabashedly tropical on the nose and palate with gobs of ripe mango, guava and peach, this cheerful Chardonnay is fresh and juicy, with lemon-lime acidity and a surprisingly-elegant minerality on the finish. From an estate property with only two acres planted to the variety, the rest to Pinot Noir, it exudes its Middle Reach roots, ripe and fresh, and entirely aged in stainless steel. This elegant wine, one of very few brands from Humboldt County, strikes a good balance between a ripe, delicious fruit character and moderately spicy, buttery themes, without the influence of oak.
Late Harvest;103;Surprisingly lean and light bodied, this doesn't show typical characteristics of a late harvest wine, but its a clean, refreshing dessert wine evocative of dewy, fresh wildflowers, melon and lemons with just a hint of petrol. Cold-fermented in stainless steel after being harvested at 31.4 degrees Brix, this Late-Harvest Riesling is ripe in apple and honey, with a sustained level of rich earth notes from the 134 g/L residual sugar. Impressive and elegant, with flowers and zippy citrus, pineapple and melon on the nose and refreshing waves of lemon, lime and a touch of tropical fruit to round it out on the palate.
Bien Nacido Vineyard;115;This Bill Price and Gavin Chanin partnership project from the renowned vineyard is fairly light and bright, with aromas of cherry blossom, raspberry juice and gravel, showing some bitter and sour elements on the nose as well. Clean and crisp aromas of Gravenstein apples, Bartlett pear and key lime pith meet with a slight hint of smoke wafting in the background on this bottling by onetime wunderkind Gavin Chanin. This brilliant Chardonnay has the ripe citrus and tropical fruit you want, but is also refined in winemaker technique, particularly a leesy note that marries well with the pineapples in sweet clotted cream.
Estate Reserve;120;From stunningly set vines overlooking the Carmel Valley that in this vintage produced only 1.25 tons an acre (or 1.12 pounds per plant) comes this stellar wine, redolent on the nose with black plum, mulberry, turned earth, wet mud, woody sagebrush, incense and sandalwood. Aromas of red apple, toasted challah, honeycomb and banana cream pie slowly unfold in the bouquet and carry through to the medium-weight palate, where it is balanced by medium acidity and supporting tones of sweet citrus oil and baking spice. From an amazing vineyard set at 1,200 feet with ocean views across the Carmel Valley, this bottling shows soft plum and strawberry fruit along with wild thyme, wet slate, a touch of smoke and purple-flower essence.
Vintage;122;"It's in the soft, rich and ripe style of the year; its flavors of black plum juice and sweet berry have a rounded character, with underlying structure that promises good aging. While 2011 has been widely seen as one of the great Port vintages for long-term aging, there are also wines, like this, that are so attractive they can be drunk early. Based on the Roêda vineyard, this opulent, fruity wine is dense, beautifully ripe, a powerhouse of sweet fruit, figs and raisins, plum jelly and the roundest, most generous tannins."
Single Vineyard;123;This medium-bodied wine shows a remarkable evolution on the palate, where it accelerates through tight, reined-in notions of gun flint and vague leafiness to pinwheels of pink grapefruit and tomato leaf by the long finish. Fresh, light aromas of raspberry and milk chocolate give the wine legitimacy, but for the most part it's simply a lean, sassy Pinot with racy red-fruit flavors, warmth and a touch of sweet oak. This is on the more herbal side of the Sauvignon Blanc spectrum, showing obvious notes of tomato leaf and boxwood, but there's ample white grapefruit to back up those green elements.
Réserve;141;The Cazes family, which owns the Michel Lynch brand (as well as Château Lynch-Bages), also has vineyards in the Graves, and this well-rounded, spice- and pear-flavored wine draws on good vineyard contacts in that region. A solid, well-made white at a bargain price, this medium-bodied blend of Viognier, Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Marsanne delivers mixed citrus aromas and flavors, accented by just a hint of pith on the finish. A French version of a brand that is more familiar in Chile as Viña San Esteban, this wine has more stylistically to do with South America than southwest France.
Rosé;155;It starts with layers of cherry, flowers and strawberry on the nose, then offers a combination of fresh fruit and peppery spice on the palate Overall it has a zippy, clean character that is well balanced and substantial. This wine is lively and fresh but the exuberant surface is supported by a firm and taut structure of subtle autolysis that provides the perfect backdrop for all the tart, refreshing berry fruit. Although this blend of 52% Chardonnay and 48% Pinot Noir is fruit-driven and on the round and creamy side of things, it's still a well-made, attractive rosé that should find wide appeal.
Rosé of;160;A partnership between Julia Jackson of Jackson Family Wines and Hélène Seillan, whose mentor is her father, Pierre Seillan of Vérité, this wine is lithe and complex, made from 100% Cabernet Franc, and shows plum and tangerine atop layered, pronounced acidity and a depth of weight that belies its lightness of being. Made from both grapes directly pressed into wine as well as bled off, this crisply complex offering is springtime in a glass, a soft and supple evoking of fresh-cut pineapple that remains dry and delicious without ever overreaching. A deep mauve in color, so much it could be mistaken for a light red wine, this wine offers baked cherry, warm plum fruit and a touch of iron on the nose.
Extra Dry;188;"Vintner Guglielmo Bortolomiol (not to be confused with the Prosecco estate of the same name) delivers a dry, tonic sparkler with steely effervescence and soft tones of yellow fruit and spring flower. This is a tight and firm style of Prosecco with lively perlage and aromatic characteristics that veer towards talc powder and white flower more than they do peachy fruit or honey. There’s a delicacy and lightness to the body, but the intensity of its flavors is assaultive; it’s a combination of peaches, warm cheese and a hint of something very dry and citrusy."
Old Vine;204;The partnership with Winemaker Guy Davis of Davis Family Vineyards sources from three old-vine sites, including Doug Rafanelli's, to make a balanced wine marked by savory black olive, black pepper and a strong current of Italian deli aromas and flavors. Aromas of minty berries, tobacco, rustic leather and a very strong camphor scent introduce the nose, and then a lively, quite foamy acidity consumes the palate, where flavors of sweet berries are cut by garden herbs and pepper. A great representative of Australian Grenache, with flavors of black fruit, road tar and raspberry liqueur fading to a palate of brambly fruit, all of which is couched in mocha and vanilla tones from toasty French oak.
Tradition;213;This is Capture's unoaked Sauvignon Blanc, although it was aged on the lees, lending the wine a rich creaminess to the very ripe lemon, lime and tropical fruit flavors, which taste a bit sweet on the finish. Robust in black pepper and intense black fruit, this has a tension of freshness and red cherry, making for a complex and intriguing wine with noticeable structure and a refreshing finish. Made from organically grown grapes, this blend of 30% Syrah, 30% Mourvèdre, 30% Grenache and 10% Carignan boasts a pleasant balance of ripe black-fruit tones and earthy, herbal hints of garrigue.
Gran Reserva;247;"Take a cool year like 2010—which is tough to begin with—on a late ripener like Cabernet, and throw in a ton of char and burnt oak, and what you get is a wine that smells like a smoldering campfire. Stewy, earthy and muddled on the nose, this gran reserva from a notoriously cold and wet vintage comes across as forced, as if long hangtime was sought to offset poor weather conditions. This Cabernet feels saturated, pure and deep; flavors of blackberry, cassis, prune and chocolate are ripe and generous, while the finish is mildly herbal in flavor, with good length and build."
Barrel Sample;249;Promoted to Saint-Emilion's elite Premier Grand Cru Classé category, Valandraud's 2012 shows both a mineral character and intense acidity to go with the smooth and beautiful black currant fruits. One of the largest vineyards in the Médoc, Larose Trintaudon has produced a reliable, attactively fruity wine with soft tannins, blackberry-juice flavors and a crisp acidity at the end. Made from grapes grown in a specific parcel in the Léoville Las Cases vineyard, Clos du Marquis is a ripe wine that's also promises seriously good aging.
Brut Rosé;255;Extremely fresh and lively aromas of soft strawberry and lime pith combine to make a very racy edge to the nose of this bottling from the pioneering property, which was founded as a bubbly house in the early 1980s. Made from a majority of Pinot Noir grapes from several estate vineyards, as well as Chardonnay and a smidgen of Pinot Meunier, this sparkling rosé offers flavors of creamy strawberry and raspberry, the fruit ripe and succulent. This is a soft and sophisticated sparkling blend of Pinot Nero and Chardonnay (in a rosé version) that opens with a delicate pink color and pristine aromas of toasted almond, stone fruit, cassis and white pepper.
Vieilles Vignes;285;Vanilla, cedar and plum cake aromas, licorice, plum, and cocoa on the palate have a lot to recommend them, while the muscular midpalate and firmness of the tannins on the finish suggest agreeability but not much charm. Old-vine Grenache (80%, the balance is Syrah) aged in old oak casks has resulted in a wine textured like heavy cream or velvet, with the merest hints of vanilla and cedar to the cherry fruit. Dark and concentrated but simultaneously fresh and juicy, this blend of 65% Syrah and 35% Grenache offers heady notes of black cherry, plum and raspberry accented by hints of game and tree bark.
Crianza;312;The nose offers up spice and berry aromas along with some buttery oak, and that creamy woodiness carries onto the palate and blends well with juicy, crisp red fruit flavors that are representative of the vintage and region. A fresh snap of acidity keeps weighty fruit and oak tannins in check, while raspberry, plum, pepper and bitter espresso flavors roll onto a seamless finish with black pepper and additional bitter notes. With fresh raspberry aromas, zesty acidity and earthy flavors of red berry and spice offset by cocoa and vanilla, this is akin to Bordeaux and it should go nicely with most kinds of food.
Estate Bottled;318;"John Chiarito is the first American to petition for the right to label his wine Nero d'Avola, a variety he grows just outside of the town of Ukiah in eastern Mendocino and a nod to his family's Southern Italian heritage (the grape is native to Sicily). The Amador Zin specialist is offering its first ever Grenache here, a tremendous debut, super light in color and texture, lightly rendered to show off its layers of delicate violet and raspberry amid a meatier backbone of lurking anise and herbs. Heady plum and dark berry aromas give a warning of size and ripeness, and indeed there's a ton of ripe fruit to the palate; but the wine is also raw, untamed and lacking in mouthfeel."
Barrel sample;367;With its minty aroma and high proportion of new wood, this is a wine which shows polish, a smooth, wood-laden texture offering a wine that will probably age quickly. From a vineyard right on the edge of the city of Saint-Emilion, this is a rounded wine, packed with ripe and generous fruit, black cherries and velvet tannins. Although the aromas are heavily of wood, the fruit has a fresh lift, giving some spices, with a core of tannin coming through to finish with some juiciness.
Dry;380;Established in the early 70s by Ed O'Keefe Jr., this Michigan winery remains in the family to this day and maintains the founding father's focus on producing wines from 100% vinifera grapes in a region where hybrids might be the easier option. A pretty, floral wine, bright with melon and honey, straightforwardly lean and ready to drink at your next picnic, hike or ski trip, a great value for a solidly well-made wine with texture to pair with charcuterie, falafel or spiced chickpeas. Salmon-peach in color this rosé is made from 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Malbec and 10% Pinot Noir, the end result of which is a thirst-quenching array of pineapple and papaya aromas and flavors in a crisp, straightforward package.
Brut;474;A blend of 80% Pinot Nero and 20% Chardonnay, this vibrant sparkler offers delicate, appealing aromas of apple, mature pear, toast and bread crust that carry over to the expressive palate along with a note of citrus zest. A blend of Chenin Blanc, Cabernet Franc and Chardonnay, this is a round, mouthfilling sparkling wine with ripe apple flavors layered with grapefruit acidity and a tight, final texture that is crisp and mineral. Made mostly from Chardonnay, with a touch of Pinot Noir, this is so rich and creamy, it's like satin gliding across the mouth, carrying waves of lemon- and lime-infused buttercream, brioche and a smoky flavor.
Estate Grown;567;High in acidity and low in oak, at least on the palate, and indeed aged in a majority of neutral French barrels, this wine is bright in lemon and green apple, with a suggestion of mango, falling somewhat flat on the finish. A larger offering from the producer from a selection of sites, this shows a prowess of blending in its grippy, classic elements of black pepper and currant, a focused display of savory edges around elusive fruit that makes for a compelling experience. Exotic wafts of almond and lemongrass make way for an intensity of lemon pith and grapefruit in this wholly satisfying, well-crafted and refreshingly complex white, a sure sign that this variety can thrive in the appellation.
Riserva;647;Bright and light at first almost like a California Pinot Noir, with red fruit and cola paying a visit, the blend of mostly Sangiovese (79%), 20% Barbera and 5% Petit Verdot drinks big and full with a rustic finish. Black pepper, espresso, dark berries and woody herbs show on the nose of this blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Sangiovese, 13% Petit Verdot, 6% Merlot and 6% Freisa from the Los Alamos and Valley View Vineyards. Not an obvious wine by any stretch, this riserva opens slowly and bashfully to deliver small pulses of cherry, chocolate and smoked bacon that build in intensity and power as the wine gains momentum in the glass.
Reserva;1176;"Aromas of Christmas spice, pepper and dried fruit fall more into the traditional category than modern, while the palate is snappy, a little lean and delivers strawberry and raspberry fruit with a light buttery oak note. The fruit here is ripe and lush, with plenty of herbal essence, and for every drop of plum or black cherry there's a balancing hint of green herb and bell pepper, which does not signal underripeness. An improvement over the dull, mulchy 2005; this wine is still a little earthy, heavy and gaseous out of the bottle but with airing it offers ripe strawberry and plum flavors with licorice and tree-bark accents."
Estate;1223;From vines now a dozen years old, this unusual Walla Walla AVA Sauvignon Blanc is a brilliant straw color—aromatic with light scents of ripe grain and tangy fruits, and fills the mouth with delicious flavors of melon, white peach, lemon verbena and a dash of pepper. This has really evolved over the past 10 months since I tasted it at the winery, going from crisp and pineapple-y then to more honeyed and tropical now, with opulent layers of peach and mango that coat the mouth on the long finish. Either this producer is one of the most honest when it comes to listing alcohol levels or this is as close to Port as it gets, a Primitivo that's got some cherry brightness to it, but gets bogged down by its own bigness.
Reserve;1871;With serious structure and a firm grip, this 100% Cabernet from Livermore's vaulty Concannon is a very impressive effort from a strong vintage that's easy drinking and well integrated, tasting great right now with plenty of rich tannins, pleasing blueberry and cassis with a shot of chocolate on the finish for good measure. Deep and dark in color, this unusual Lodi bottling of Teroldego, an ancient Italian variety akin to California Zinfandel, is a beast of rich red fruit and chocolate mocha, still robustly tannic and a tad smoky, able to definitely lie down in darkness for several more years. A soft, feminine nose of toasted oak and round fruit on the nose, and a flavor profile of balanced fruit and acid on the palate, make this a good white for both cold weather, serious meals and just sipping on the patio in warmer months.
